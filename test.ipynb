They are so specific, and when you want one, that desire doesn't go away until you're stuffing one into your mouth, enjoying the interplay of brown sugar-infused dough and pools of chocolate.\\n\\nWhen I get the craving for a chocolate chip cookie, I don't have the taste in my mouth for Chips Ahoy or that giant cookie that moves people to stand in line. Instead, I put on my apron and check that there is butter in the fridge. Somehow I've convinced myself it's easier than driving to a local bakery, although we have no dearth of terrific options. The only one I can walk to has excellent cookies and a perennial line.\\n\\nThe great benefit to making your own chocolate chip cookie is that you can customize it to your taste. Most of us have particular preferences that fuel our yearning. Do you prefer a chewy or crisp cookie? Are the inclusions bitter, bittersweet, or milk chocolate? Are they discs of couverture chocolate or traditional chips? Do you like nuts in your chippers? Can you wait 24 to 36 hours for the dough to \\\"age,\\\" thus ensuring a more flavorful result, or do you need them now?\\n\\nRecipe-wise, I usually go one of two ways. If I'm willing to wait just a little bit and work a tiny bit harder, my favorite is Kim Boyce's Whole Wheat Chocolate Chip Cookies from her classic cookbook Good to the Grain. This is a cookie that is surprisingly savory, which may be a strange thing to say about a sweet. But the heartier flavor of whole wheat flour blunts the sugar's sweetness just enough to make the eating experience extremely satisfying. I don't know anyone who doesn't love these cookies once they've tried them. However, because whole wheat flour still has the germ, which is a source of oil, it goes rancid much more quickly than all-purpose flour. You really need to make sure your supply isn't compromised. It's why people opt to store it in the freezer or refrigerator, where whole wheat flour lasts well for up to six months.\\n\\nBut there are times I don't want to worry about my supply of whole wheat flour. I just want cookies now. And that means I don't even want to take the time to cream the butter and sugar together or take out my mixer. In those urgent cookie moments, I lean on Sally McKenney's recipe for Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies made with melted butter. Making them reminds me of making cookies as a child, stirring everything together in a bowl instead of using a mixer. The combination of melted butter, brown sugar, and a bit of cornstarch ensures the soft and chewy attributes of the cookie. I prefer using a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate couverture discs instead of chips. Couverture is a high-quality chocolate made with a denser concentration of cocoa butter, which gives you those seductive pools of chocolate in the cookie. And if I don't have couverture in the house, I just chop up whatever emergency chocolate bar I may have. I usually buy my couverture locally at Surfas. But if you want to lose your mind with choice, here's a good site.\\n\\nIf you're a tinkerer and love a good story and recipe of a viral cookie, here is the story of the famed New York Times chocolate chip cookie created by pastry giant Jacques Torres and tinkered with by David Leite. It's amongst the New York Times' top 20 saved recipes. The surprise ingredient here is bread flour. This cookie is why you started to see salt garnishing cookies everywhere for a while. The recipe calls for aging the dough 36 hours to create complex flavor and greater variation in texture. The bread flour adds chewiness and bend.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"kcrw.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"KCRW\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Cooking/Baking_and_Confections\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Cooking/Baking and Confections\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Cooking/For_Children\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Cooking/For Children\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Cooking/Outdoors\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Cooking/Outdoors\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Food_and_Drink\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Food and Drink\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Health\",\"label\":\"news/Health\",\"wgt\":57}],\"image\":\"https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/election-film-baking/chocolate-chip-cookies/@@images/rectangular_image/page-header?v=1727391949.77\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9944593\",\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.1686274509803922,\"wgt\":465091200,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878132\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:04\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:04Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-26T23:59:53Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.ashcroftcachecreekjournal.com/home2/west-kootenay-ferries-to-keep-operating-as-labour-dispute-goes-to-mediation-7558932\",\"title\":\"West Kootenay ferries to keep operating as labour dispute goes to mediation\",\"body\":\"The union representing ferry employees had previously issued a 72-hour strike notice\\n\\nFerries in the West Kootenay will remain in operation as labour bargaining for a new collective agreement turns to mediation.\\n\\nThe B.C.

I think I feel good about the discipline that we held this summer and the roster we built and the growth from within that we're going to have.\\\"\\n\\nGolden State lost franchise pillar Klay Thompson and Chris Paul from a team that won 46 games and lost in the first round of the play-in tournament and added versatile guard De'Anthony Melton, top shooter Buddy Hield and veteran big man Kyle Anderson in smaller moves that still give the Warriors a chance to do something bigger if it materializes during the season.\\n\\nBut for now, Dunleavy wants to see what a roster led by Curry and Draymond Green, with a hopefully revitalized Andrew Wiggins and developing young players like Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody and Tracy Jackson-Davis, can do.\\n\\n\\\"We'll take a look at it, see where we're at,\\\" Dunleavy said. \\\"The good news is we've got plenty of ways to get better from the outside, but right now we're fully behind this team, and we think they're going to have a great year.\\\"\\n\\nCoach Steve Kerr is excited about the possibilities, but knows it could be a challenge at first trying to figure out the right combinations on a team that needs to replace the scoring of Thompson and is incorporating several new players.\\n\\nBut he said he has already sensed a good vibe from his players during summer workouts and believes Golden State might be better than outsiders think.\\n\\n\\\"I do think that we've been forgotten about a little bit,\\\" he said. \\\"It makes sense where we are. We didn't make the playoffs last year. That's how it works. But I'm excited. I think we were pretty good last year, and if you win 46, that means something. Normally that's a five or six seed in the playoffs. I still think we're really good. We'll miss Chris and Klay, but it also opens up an opportunity to maybe play a little bit differently.\\\"\\n\\nIt will all get started next week with the Warriors heading to Hawaii on Tuesday for the start of training camp. This will be the team's first trip to Hawaii since 2007.\\n\\n\\\"It'll be good for guys to get away,\\\" Dunleavy said. \\\"You get off that plane, the warm breeze blows in your face, and it's just a good place to have training camp and get better. I'm glad we're doing it. I'm not sure it's going to be a regular thing, but on the whole we're all pleased to be going.\\\"\\n\\nNOTES: Dunleavy said the team has no injury concerns to start training camp. ... Dunleavy said the team is talking with representatives for Kuminga and Moody about signing them to extensions before a deadline on Oct. 21.

Credit: YouTube.\\n\\nThe latest film releases are Megalopolis, Wolfs, The Wild Robot, and Saturday Night. Weighing in are Christy Lemire, film critic for RogerEbert.com and co-host of the YouTube channel Breakfast All Day, and Tim Grierson, senior U.S. critic for Screen International and the author of This Is How You Make a Movie.\\n\\nMegalopolis\\n\\nFrancis Ford Coppola has been working on this passion project since the early 1980s. It got a four-minute standing ovation when it debuted at the Cannes Film Festival. In the sci-fi thriller, Adam Driver plays a visionary architect who takes on a corrupt mayor played by Giancarlo Esposito. The story takes place in a futuristic metropolis trying to rebuild after a natural disaster.\\n\\nLemire: \\\"[Coppola] reportedly sold a bunch of his ... big wine business to raise the $120 million to get it made, which is always the first mistake in making movies, right? You don't use your own money. But he meant to do this for so long. It was so meaningful to him.\\n\\nIt is this two and a half hour, ambitious, big swing with this giant cast. ... Adam Driver is this brilliant and visionary architect named Cesar Catilina. He has this image of New Rome, which is essentially New York City as this gleaming metropolis. And he lives inside the top of the Chrysler Building, and that's his apartment/workspace. He has the ability to stop time, which is a thing that they don't really use all that effectively. He is clashing with the mayor ... Giancarlo Esposito. And the woman in between them is the mayor's daughter, played by Nathalie Emmanuel. She is drawn to both of these men for their ideas about how the world should be.\\n\\nThere's a lot of speechifying here. Adam Driver is saddled with big, chunky blocks of exposition and hammering us over the head with Coppola's philosophy. So it's very talky, but it's also dazzlingly beautiful at times, it's intentionally heightened in its artificiality. But it's all different kinds of movies slammed together and made these wild tonal shifts. So I was never bored, but it's a total mess.\\\"\\n\\nGrierson: \\\"I don't take any pleasure in saying I don't think the movie works very much at all. You can feel Coppola's passion and his sadness. Obviously, this movie is supposed to be a metaphor for America, and a dying America, and a dying democracy. And you can feel the decades of anguish that went into this film in terms of how he feels about America, and how America is essentially the modern Roman Empire that's losing its way, and is collapsing into hedonism and sensationalism.\\n\\nBut that passion that Coppola feels, I don't think translates into a very compelling story. I don't think it translates into many compelling performances. I think Adam Driver is okay in the film. ... Characters are representing different ideas in the movie. They're symbols. They're not really people in this movie. And I think that's a big problem.\\n\\n... I don't think people are going to come back and say, 'No, this is an amazing movie.' I don't want to recommend people see the movie because I don't think it's good. But it does remind me of those 1970s movies, where American auteurs really just put their heart and souls into their movies. There's a part of me that's like, if you want to support adventurous, doing-it-your-way cinema, give it a try. But I think most people will be disappointed in the experience.\\\"\\n\\nWolfs\\n\\nBrad Pitt and George Clooney play fixers who typically work alone, and now they're hired as a team to cover up a high-profile crime.\\n\\nGrierson: \\\"If you are a fan of the Oceans 11 series that Steven Soderbergh directed, I think that you will like Wolfs, though it is not to that level. It's written in directed by Jon Watts, who most recently has been doing the Spider-Man movies. ... It's a very light-hearted crime thriller comedy where the two main characters bicker back and forth. They don't like each other, they don't have partners. They work alone, but eventually have a begrudging respect for each other as they realize that they have to work together to figure out what the heck is going on. ... It definitely feels like a movie that you can watch at home and enjoy.\\\"\\n\\nLemire: \\\"This is not even a thing you need to watch on your couch. ... I would say this is exactly what airplane movies are for -- is to have just the light distraction of attractive A-list stars bantering with each other. There is some visual flair to it. The cinematographer also shot Everything Everywhere All At Once, and so there is some high-end sheen to it. It looks pretty great. And these guys look pretty great for being early mid-60s. They are well preserved. And of course, the camera loves them, but they are very much phoning this in. They're not doing any heavy lifting. They're not lifting anything. They are showing up and being charming.\\\"\\n\\nThe Wild Robot\\n\\nThis animated feature is from Dreamworks, based on the 2016 novel of the same name. Lupita Nyong'o voices a robot who gets shipwrecked on a remote island, where she develops relationships with the native animals.\\n\\nLemire: \\\"It is breathtakingly beautiful. ... It feels like hands touched it. There is a tactile quality to the colors and the animation. It feels like you're looking at fresh strokes. It's gorgeous over and over again.\\n\\n... It's meant for adults and also for little kids, and it works well on both levels, in that way. And it's a lot of fun, and surprisingly, a little twisted and weird and dark. I really loved a lot of the humor from the beginning, and then it gets super heavy-handed and treacly in the third act, and it spells everything out.\\\"\\n\\nGrierson: \\\"Chris Sanders, who wrote and directed this, who had done the first How to Train Your Dragon, he has talked about the fact that Hayao Miyazaki was a real influence on the film, especially Miyazaki's depictions of the natural world. ... And you can feel that in The Wild Robot.\\n\\nOne of the real pleasures ... is the robot, Roz, is trying to figure out: How did I get on this island, how do I adapt with all of these animals? And the movie actually reveals these things in really interesting ways.\\n\\n... The third act, my only reservation was more that I think it gets more actiony. The emotional stuff didn't bother me because I think I was very much on the wavelength of the film. And it's a movie really ... about motherhood. But it's also a movie about de facto families, the families that you create, as opposed to the ones that you were born in to. And that's really very touching and really closely observed. So in terms of recent, mainstream animated movies, I think this is one of the better ones that have come along. ... I actually saw this in IMAX, if you can do it that way, absolutely do it ... because the animation is gorgeous. And also Chris Bowers' score is really wonderful in this film.\\\"\\n\\nSaturday Night\\n\\nDirector Jason Reitman's comedy-drama shows what happens when young comedians, writers, and a producer get ready for the first broadcast of Saturday Night Live on Oct. 11, 1975. It is not a documentary.\\n\\nGrierson: \\\"This is an Aaron Sorkin, like everybody-walk-around-and-talk-fast kind of thing. It's almost done as if it's in real time. ... It's the last 90 minutes before the very first episode of Saturday Night Live ... is going to hit the air. And we're watching as Lorne Michaels, played by Gabriel LaBelle ... is desperately trying to put out 10,000 fires; in one case, a literal fire. ... And there's also the superficial nostalgic pleasure of watching actors, for the most part, really do dead-on impressions of the comedy stars that we know so well. Cory Michael Smith is a stunning Chevy Chase, Dylan O'Brien is really good as Dan Aykroyd.\\n\\nMy reservations about the movie are just -- I think that beyond the superficial pleasures, there's nothing much deeper going on, though. I think Jason Reitman wants us to feel like something deeper is going on, but I think the movie is a little too superficial, a little too glib. It never really digs into its characters.\\\"\\n\\nLemire: \\\"What's interesting about ... how incredible the casting is and how dead on the performances are, they're playing our ideas of the personas of these people, right? So there's fun to be had in that, the recognition to be had in that. ... It is empty, rollicking fun.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"kcrw.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"KCRW\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Arts_and_Entertainment\",\"label\":\"news/Arts and Entertainment\",\"wgt\":100}],\"image\":\"https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/election-film-baking/megalopolis-wolfs-wild-robot-sat-night/@@images/rectangular_image/page-header?v=1727392062.16\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1},\"sentiment\":0.1764705882352942,\"wgt\":465091208,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878060\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:10\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:10Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-26T23:59:41Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.5882353186607361,\"url\":\"https://tass.com/world/1848473\",\"title\":\"Bigger number of nuclear countries raises risks of nuclear weapons use  --  IAEA chief\",\"body\":\"Certain countries are trying to normalize the conversation of nuclear weapons and their proliferation, and it is the duty of the IAEA to prevent it, Rafael Grossi said\\n\\nNEW YORK, September 27. /TASS/.

The condition is characterised by red, scaly patches that impact the quality of a patient's life and can sometimes be life-threatening.\\n\\nNew research strongly suggests the hormone hepcidin may trigger the onset of the condition. This marks the first time hepcidin has been considered a potential causal factor. In mammals, hepcidin is responsible for regulating iron levels in the body.\\n\\nThe international research team behind this discovery -- which includes Dr Charareh Pourzand from the Department of Life Sciences, the Centre for Therapeutic Innovation and the Centre for Bioengineering and Biomedical Technologies at the University of Bath in the UK -- hopes their finding will lead to the development of new drugs able to block the action of the hormone.\\n\\nThose most likely to benefit from such a treatment are patients with pustular psoriasis (PP) -- a particularly severe and treatment-resistant form of the disease that can affect a patient's nails and joints as well as skin.\\n\\nDr Pourzand, who studies ways to mitigate iron imbalances in the skin, said: \\\"Psoriasis is a life-changing dermatological disease. Patients face a potentially disfiguring and lifelong affliction that profoundly affects their lives, causing them both physical discomfort and emotional distress. The condition can also lead to other serious health conditions.\\n\\n\\\"A new treatment targeting iron hormone imbalance in the skin offers hope. This innovative approach could significantly enhance the quality of life for millions, restoring their confidence and wellbeing.\\\"\\n\\nWe need skin iron -- but not too much\\n\\nIron is an essential trace metal, not just for transporting oxygen through the body's circulatory system but also for maintaining healthy skin: it's involved in many essential cellular functions, including wound healing, collagen production and immune function. However, iron overload in the skin can be harmful, amplifying the damaging effects of UV sunlight and causing hyperproliferative chronic diseases (where cells grow and multiply more than normal), including psoriasis.\\n\\nStudies going back 50 years have reported high iron concentrations in the skin cells of psoriatic patients, however the cause of this excess and its significance to the condition have remained unclear until now.\\n\\nThe new study -- published in the high-impact academic journal Nature Communications -- is the first to name hepcidin as the likely link.\\n\\nHepcidin is responsible for controlling how much iron is absorbed from food and later released into the body. In healthy individuals, it's produced exclusively in the liver, however the new study has found that in people with psoriasis, the hormone is also generated in the skin.\\n\\nExposure to hepcidin triggers iron overload\\n\\nIn the new study, mice (which have many genetic and physiological similarities to humans) developed a rodent form of psoriasis after being exposed to high levels of skin-produced hepcidin.\\n\\nThis over-abundance of the hormone caused the animals' skin cells to retain far more iron than was required. In turn, this excess iron triggered both a hyperproliferation of skin cells and an abnormally high concentration of inflammation-inducing neutrophils (a type of immune system cell) in the topmost layer of skin.\\n\\nThese two outcomes -- an overproduction of skin cells and an abundance of neutrophils -- are main features of human psoriasis.\\n\\nPsoriasis runs in families though experts believe 'environmental' factors such as weight, infections and smoking are also triggers.\\n\\nA disease with no cure\\n\\nCurrently there is no cure for psoriasis, though treatments that include topical creams, light therapy and oral drugs can help keep symptoms under control for patients with some forms of the condition. Recent treatments have focused on targeting the immune pathways that contribute to psoriasis developing.\\n\\nDr Pourzand believes a drug targeting hepcidin has the potential to dramatically improve treatment options for all psoriasis patients.\\n\\nShe said: \\\"Our data strongly suggests hepcidin would be a good target for skin psoriasis treatment. A drug that can control this hormone could be used to treat flare-ups and keep patients in remission to prevent recurrence.\\n\\n\\\"Also, by adjusting the excess iron in psoriatic skin with customised iron chelators (substances that bind to excess iron in the body and help remove it), we would aim to halt the uncontrolled proliferation of psoriatic skin cells. This hyperproliferation is a major focus of our laboratory's research on psoriasis therapy, conducted in collaboration with national and international scientists from the Skin@Bath Network, including those from this study.\\\"\\n\\nDr William Tillett, a senior lecturer at the University of Bath and a consultant rheumatologist specialising in the diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis, said: \\\"This research from Dr Pourzand and colleagues is an exciting step forward for people living with psoriasis and for the clinical teams treating them.\\n\\n\\\"We don't know exactly why people develop psoriasis but the identification of hepcidin as an important factor in the development of the disease opens doors not only to potential new treatments but also to the possibility of preventing the disease developing in people at high risk. Existing drugs -- called biologics -- can be highly effective but they are costly and rationed in the UK. Furthermore, these drugs don't work for everyone and they can stop working after a while, so a new approach to treatment would be very welcome.\\\"\\n\\nHe added: \\\"However, developing drugs is notoriously time consuming and costly, so a new treatment won't be available immediately and it's important for patients to manage expectations.\\\"\\n\\nDr Penelope Pratsou, a consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the UK charity the British Skin Foundation, said: \\\"The findings of this study shed new light on the pathophysiology of psoriasis, with hepcidin overabundance in psoriatic skin thought to be another culprit. These results appear promising for patients, though more research is required to further elucidate the role of hepcidin and its potential as a prospective treatment target in psoriasis.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"sciencedaily.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"ScienceDaily\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Health\",\"label\":\"news/Health\",\"wgt\":91}],\"image\":\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9946336\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":8},\"sentiment\":0.05882352941176472,\"wgt\":465091213,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878192\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:19\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:19Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-26T23:59:55Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.5647059082984924,\"url\":\"https://www.eurasiareview.com/27092024-the-houthi-attacks-in-the-red-sea-impact-on-yemen-analysis/\",\"title\":\"The Houthi Attacks In The Red Sea: Impact On Yemen - Analysis\",\"body\":\"By Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA)\\n\\nThe involvement of the Houthis in the Israel-Hamas war has affected the progress of the negotiations between the internationally recognised government of Yemen and the Houthis. The intra-Yemeni dialogue which was advancing since the agreement between the government of Yemen and the Houthis in April 2022 and the rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran in March 2023, is now facing hurdles. The conflict has created new obstacles in the intra-Yemeni dialogue, slowing the pace of talks and further eroding trust among the parties. The delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people is also disrupted. The Houthis have detained a number of UN officials, diplomatic and international NGO staff working in Yemen. Besides, they have also seized ships and detained crew members who continue to be under Houthi custody. These developments are also worsening Yemen's political, security and economic situation, making the prospects for peace more tenuous.\\n\\nAfter long drawn out negotiations, in April 2022, a two-month UN-mediated ceasefire agreement was signed between the Yemeni government and the Houthis. The parties agreed to stop their military offensive, allow fuel ships to the Hodeida port, and resume flight operations from Sanaa to Egypt and Jordan.1 As a result, the situation improved significantly, although sporadic instances of violence were still reported. The drop in instances of armed clashes and casualties was a positive and tangible achievement for Yemen since the beginning of the war in 2015. The agreement was renewed in June and August 2022 for two months each time. However, it could not be extended beyond October 2022 due to differences between the parties.\\n\\nIn March 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran signed a landmark normalisation agreement, which had a positive impact on the situation in Yemen. For the first time since the beginning of the Saudi-led military intervention in 2015, both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis showed a willingness to engage in dialogue and address their longstanding conflict. This led to several rounds of negotiations, including a visit by a Houthi delegation to Riyadh, where they met the Saudi Defence Minister. Saudi officials later described the discussions as positive, with both parties expressing optimism about reaching a mutually acceptable resolution to their disputes.\\n\\nThe internal security situation in Yemen also improved following the rapprochement, with a marked reduction in violence. The UN voiced its support for the talks between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis, expressing hope that a comprehensive peace agreement could be achieved. The engagement between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis was seen as a crucial step towards resolving the conflict in Yemen and stabilising the region.\\n\\nIn April 2023, around 900 prisoners were released from both sides, after the Government of Yemen and the Houthis agreed to a prisoner swap deal. In the same month, Saudi and Omani officials visited Sanaa and held mediatory discussions with the stakeholders. In September 2023, a Houthi delegation visited Riyadh for the first time, since the beginning of the war in Yemen, for discussion with the Saudi officials. At a time when it looked like the peace talks were moving in the right direction, Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, and subsequently Israel declared war on Hamas and attacked Gaza.\\n\\nAs the war broke out between Israel and Hamas, the Houthis declared their support for Palestine and joined the war against Israel. They started targeting the commercial ships in the Red Sea, which they believed were linked to Israel. Later, they targeted ships in the Red Sea, which were not linked to Israel at all. This created tensions in the waters of the Red Sea. A 20-nation military coalition led by the US named 'Operation Prosperity Guardian' was formed to ensure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. The UK and the US, since then, have undertaken several attacks on the Houthi targets inside Yemen. The Operation Prosperity Guardian has been successful to a large extent in deterring Houthi attacks on the vessels in the Red Sea.\\n\\nThe Houthis launched several rockets and UAVs towards Israel. Some of them have hit their targets in the southern port city of Eilat. As a result of the attacks, the operations at the Eilat port have been closed since November 2023.2 In a major retaliatory attack, Israel hit an oil facility in Hodeida. The Houthis have only limited capability to hurt Israel physically, but their involvement in the War has affected the peace process in Yemen significantly.\\n\\nThere is a growing concern among the regional stakeholders and the UN that the Houthi involvement in the war could jeopardise the progress made so far in the Yemeni peace process since April 2022. The UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Hans Grundberg, expressed his apprehension that the Yemeni peace talks should not be a 'collateral damage' of the Israel-Hamas war.3 The UN has urged the Houthis to adhere to the agreements made and de-escalate the tensions to prevent any negative impact on the peace process in Yemen. In the March 2024 UN Security Council Monthly Forecast for Yemen, Grundberg stated that the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have \\\"stalled-and risk upending-Yemen's peace talks\\\".4 He also noted that there is a growing armed clashes and violence in Yemen.\\n\\nIn December 2023, after a number of parleys in Saudi Arabia and Oman, Yemeni parties committed to a ceasefire and agreed to a roadmap. Elements of this roadmap included resumption of oil exports (a major source of revenue for the economy), payment of salaries of civil servants, opening of roads in Taiz and easing restrictions on Sanaa Airport and the Hodeida port.5 But in March 2024, as the Houthis stepped up their attacks in the Red Sea, the Yemeni government suspended the implementation of this roadmap.\\n\\nThe internationally recognised government of Yemen has severely condemned the activities of the Houthis in the Red Sea. It has described the Houthi attack on the ships in the Red Sea as \\\"systematic terrorism\\\" and says that the Houthi actions would lead to economic and environmental disaster in the region.6 The Yemeni government alleges that by escalating attacks in the Red Sea, the Houthis have undermined the ongoing political process in the country. It also accuses Iran of supplying weapons to the Houthis which leads to the worsening of humanitarian crisis.7 Besides, the Yemeni government accuses the Houthis of imposing an economic siege as the number of ships carrying humanitarian assistance to Yemen has decreased as well.8\\n\\nThere is a fundamental difference in the thinking between the Yemeni government and the Houthis. While the Yemeni government believes that the State and its institutions must be strengthened to provide security and humanitarian access to the people, the Houthis do not want to lose control of the areas and cede any authority to the former.\\n\\nThe US, while remaining engaged in the peace process, has taken military action against the Houthis for their disruptive activities in the Red Sea. In January 2024, as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea increased, the US announced the designation of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group. For the US, Houthi attacks on the vessels in the Red Sea are acts of terrorism.9 The US states that these attacks must stop for the peace talks to progress without any hurdles. The US has stated that the Houthi attacks have not only affected the regional countries but the Yemeni people as well. It has expressed its apprehension that the escalation in the region will have a negative impact on the peace talks in Yemen.\\n\\nOman and Saudi Arabia share land borders with Yemen and have significant stakes in the resolution of the conflict. Saudi Arabia, having fought a prolonged military campaign against the Houthis since 2015, finds itself in a complex geopolitical and security situation. Despite the recent escalation in the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia has refrained from taking a more forceful stance against the Houthis. This delicate balancing act reflects the nuanced position of Saudi Arabia towards the conflict in its neighbourhood. Saudi position can be understood from the fact that it has engaged with the Houthis in negotiations and does not want any military confrontation which would derail the achievements made in this regard.\\n\\nOman has been mediating between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis and making diplomatic efforts to reach a political solution. Muscat has condemned the Israeli attack on the Houthis stating that it will further escalate and complicate the situation. In response to the Houthi attacks, the US and the UK launched a number of rocket and UAV attacks on the Houthi military targets inside Yemen. Oman has condemned these targeted attacks and expressed its concern over the attacks by \\\"friendly countries\\\".10 Despite the deteriorating situation and involvement of the Houthis in the war against Israel, Oman and Saudi Arabia want to preserve the progress made in their engagement with the Houthis.\\n\\nApart from the attack on vessels in the Red Sea, the Houthis have undertaken several provocative actions which threaten to derail the relative peace achieved in the country since April 2022. There are reports of increasing mobilisation of troops and occurrence of violent armed clashes in several parts of the country and the overall security environment remains unpredictable. This can potentially flare up the situation and seriously deteriorate the conditions.\\n\\nIn June 2024, the Houthis seized three Yemenia Airlines planes in Sanaa. This resulted in hundreds of pilgrims getting stranded in Riyadh as these planes would have carried them back home. The Yemeni government accused the Houthis of escalation while the Houthis alleged the government of 'plundering the company's revenues'.11\\n\\nIn June 2024, Houthis detained 11 UN personnel from different parts of the country. They have also abducted a number of Yemenis working for humanitarian organisations and aid agencies in Yemen. The Houthis suspect the involvement of these people in an espionage network providing vital military intelligence to the US and Israel.12 Despite the appeal from the UN Secretary-General for their unconditional release, the Houthis have still kept them hostage.\\n\\nOn 3 August, Houthis seized the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) headquarters in Sanaa. After more than two weeks, they handed the office back to the UN on 19 August. Such unilateral and provocative actions by the Houthis at a time when substantial gains have been achieved are major challenges for re-establishing peace and stability in the country. It also creates impediments to the smooth delivery of humanitarian assistance to the millions of Yemenis who are in dire need of aid for their survival.\\n\\nYemen's economy remains highly fragile and reviving economic life is a priority for the country. Political unity and stability of the country is necessary to revive the economy. With the Houthi attacks on the Red Sea and slowed down peace talks, the economy of the country continues to suffer. Oil exports, a major revenue source, have been severely impacted by the prolonged conflict in the country. Due to the damage to the oil infrastructure during the war and the absence of foreign investment in the energy sector, Yemen's economy has been deeply affected. Infrastructure throughout the country remains damaged and needs to be rebuilt. In such a bleak economic condition, the Houthi involvement in the Israel-Hamas war presents an additional obstacle further hindering Yemen's prospects for economic recovery.\\n\\nIn July 2024, a significant step forward was made as both parties reached an agreement to cooperate on two critical issues: Yemenia Airways and the country's banking sector. Both sides agreed to implement measures aimed at unifying the Yemeni Central Bank, a crucial step for economic stabilisation. Additionally, they agreed to resume air connectivity to Jordan, Egypt and India.13 These two recent developments mark important progress towards restoring essential services and improving the economic landscape in the country.\\n\\nOver a decade of instability in Yemen has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with more than 18.2 million people, including 9.8 million children, in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.14 The ongoing civil war has disrupted education, leaving millions of children out of school. Diseases such as cholera have spread across large parts of the country. The escalating tensions in the Red Sea have further impacted the delivery of vital aid, as vessels carrying humanitarian supplies face increasing challenges. At this critical juncture, a nationwide ceasefire and a consensus on a national roadmap for the future political process are essential to stabilise the country and address its pressing needs. The escalation by the Houthis significantly, hampers the aid delivery to the people.\\n\\nIndia is highly concerned about the recent developments in the Red Sea and Yemen. India has huge economic and strategic interests in the safety and security of the Sea lines of Communication in the Red Sea, the Strait of Bab el Mandab and the Gulf of Aden. Any disruption to this vital maritime route affects India's economy and security. Besides, India remains wary of the potential resurgence of piracy off the Somali coast. India has maintained a continuous naval presence in the Gulf of Aden since 2008 to counter piracy activities. Indian Navy has provided security to a large number of commercial vessels passing in the region from piracy attacks.15 Further, a large number of international commercial vessels have Indian crew members who often face difficulties when the ships are seized or hijacked. This is another area of concern for India.\\n\\nThroughout the crisis in Yemen, India has supported the government and the people of the country. India has provided food, medicines and other humanitarian aid to Yemen. India is also concerned with the activities of terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS in Yemen who get a safe haven because of the conducive environment in the country.16\\n\\nPresently, India recognises the Aden-based Presidential Leadership Council. India has repeatedly appealed for a Yemeni-led and Yemeni-owned political process to build a future roadmap for the country.17 A united and stable Yemen is a positive for India from political, economic and security viewpoints. After a long gap, India has now appointed a non-resident ambassador to Yemen. On its part, India has always offered to provide all possible support to Yemen in navigating the crisis. There is a huge potential for economic engagement with Yemen, which could be explored once the situation stabilises.\\n\\nYemen is facing multiple crises, and the involvement of Houthis in the Israel-Hamas War has further dampened the prospects of peace. The situation in the Red Sea, aggravated by the Houthi attacks, has added further complexity to the mediation efforts and weakened the potential for a peaceful resolution in Yemen. The Houthis' actions in the Red Sea have also raised doubts among mediators regarding their commitment to the peace process, deepening the trust deficit. While the UN, along with the US, Saudi Arabia and Oman, has played a pivotal role in bringing the Yemeni parties to the negotiating table and achieving a relative calm, there is a growing concern that the Houthis' involvement in the Israel-Hamas War could undermine years of diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring peace and unity in Yemen.\\n\\nViews expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Manohar Parrikar IDSA or of the Government of India.\\n\\nAbout the author: Dr Prasanta Kumar Pradhan is Research Fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"eurasiareview.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Eurasia Review\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Politics\",\"label\":\"news/Politics\",\"wgt\":66}],\"image\":\"https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/b-66.jpeg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9941261\",\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.06666666666666665,\"wgt\":465091219,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878125\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:19\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:19Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-26T23:59:51Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/national-international/rudy-giuliani-disbarred-in-dc-after-pushing-trumps-false-2020-election-claims/3501370/\",\"title\":\"Rudy Giuliani disbarred in DC after pushing Trump's false 2020 election claims\",\"body\":\"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was disbarred in Washington, D.C., Thursday, months after he lost his law license in New York for pursuing false claims that then-President Donald Trump made about his 2020 presidential election loss.\\n\\nThe brief ruling from D.C.'s appeals court said Giuliani did not respond to an order to explain why he should not be disbarred in Washington after he was in New York last summer.\\n\\nTed Goodman, a spokesperson for Giuliani, called the decision \\\"an absolute travesty and a total miscarriage of justice.\\\" Giuliani has argued that he believed the claims he was making on behalf of the Trump campaign were true.\\n\\n\\\"Members of the legal community who want to protect the integrity of our justice system should immediately speak out against this partisan, politically motivated decision,\\\" Goodman said in a text message.\\n\\nIt's the latest blow to the man once lauded as \\\"America's mayor.\\\" His advocacy of Trump's false election claims has also led to criminal charges.

After a Week 3 loss to the reigning Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, here are a few keys to what the Falcons must accomplish to get back in the win column and to a .500 record.\\n\\nThe pass rush must wake up and get to Derek Carr early\\n\\nDefensive coordinator Jimmy Lake's defense has been good, but they need to improve in the pass rush department. Out of 32 NFL teams, the Falcons rank 31st with only three sacks on the season.\\n\\nWhile edge defender Matt Judon accounts for half of the team's sack total, one would hope he can make a more significant impact on Sunday. Additionally, no one on the team, sans Grady Jarrett, has yet to generate more than five-total pressures on the season.\\n\\nSimply put, they must get to Saints veteran quarterback Derek Carr, who has repeatedly shown that he is prone to turnovers under pressure. With Carr missing a valuable offensive lineman, the pass rush has no excuse not to produce in Week 4.\\n\\nThe Falcons Podcast: Spotify | Apple Pods | iHeart\\n\\nThe defense must focus on containing running back Alvin Kamara\\n\\nLike Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley, in Week 2, head coach Raheem Morris faces another back who has shown he can take over games in 2024.\\n\\nIn three games for New Orleans, Alvin Kamara has finished north of 100 total yards from scrimmage in each contest. Additionally, he has five total touchdowns on the season, four coming in the team's Week 2 victory against the Dallas Cowboys.\\n\\nAtlanta's defense has only allowed one rushing touchdown on the season - tied with the league's best defense: the Pittsburgh Steelers.\\n\\nThe team must keep up the quality work this week against a back who has a nose for the endzone, whether as a rusher or receiver. Kamara is listed as questionable on the Saints' injury report, but Atlanta must prepare as if he's going to play.\\n\\nThe offense must commit to running the football to win the time of possession battle\\n\\nAn area that needs improvement for Atlanta offensive coordinator Zac Robinson is his commitment to running the football. On the season, his unit ranks 18th in the NFL with 75 rushing attempts. Last week, the team was one-dimensional, with only 16 attempts for Bijan Robinson and seven for Tyler Allgeier.\\n\\nThis week, they face a Saints defense that allows opposing rushers 4.5 yards per carry. With an offensive line missing two starters, the playbook may be missing long-developing pass plays. If that is the case, more attempts on the ground will assist with gelling new starters into the offensive front.\\n\\nMoreover, more rushing attempts can wear down New Orleans's defense and keep quality pass rushers Cam Jordan and Carl Granderson from teeing off on veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins.\\n\\nFalcons must finish offensive drives in the red zone.\\n\\nLast week, the Falcons' offense stalled when it mattered most at the end of the game. The team's playmakers must step up when they reach the opposition's 20-yard line. The Falcons are 22nd in the NFL in touchdown percentage once in the red zone.\\n\\nWith up-and-coming talents Drake London and Kyle Pitts, there is no reason why the offense should not target them more often near the goal line. At 6-4 and 6-6, respectively, both players possess 'freakish' physical frames with elite athletic abilities. While London has six targets and two touchdown receptions on the year, Pitts only has three targets and one touchdown in the red zone.\\n\\nThis week, seeing both players getting the ball more in the red zone would boost the team's chances of winning.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"si.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Sports Illustrated\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":100}],\"image\":\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1919,h_1079,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/falcon_report/01j8rb8jw30z6qdfdh8y.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9941845\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":2},\"sentiment\":0.1450980392156862,\"wgt\":465091227,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878021\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:30\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:30Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-26T23:59:36Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.9960784316062927,\"url\":\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240926131929.htm\",\"title\":\"Scientists discover important blood pressure 'switch'\",\"body\":\"These cells include smooth muscle cells, which line our arteries. Normally, smooth muscle cells help control blood pressure by contracting and relaxing. But when blood pressure levels decrease significantly and for long periods, smooth muscle cells in the kidney, and some other kidney cell types, can take on a whole new job: producing renin, a substance typically manufactured in specialized cells in the kidneys to help maintain blood pressure.\\n\\nScientists have been uncertain what genomic triggers regulate this sudden shift to renin production, but the UVA researchers have found answers, identifying a crucial biological \\\"switch\\\" that controls the changeover and explains the cells' secret superpower.\\n\\n\\\"Discovering how the switch works will help us understand how our bodies control blood pressure,\\\" said researcher R. Ariel Gomez, MD, of UVA's Child Health Research Center. \\\"Knowing how vascular cells change their identity could help develop new medications to treat high blood pressure and vascular diseases.\\\"\\n\\nUnderstanding Blood Pressure\\n\\nGomez and his collaborator Maria Luisa S. Sequeira-Lopez, MD, are leading researchers into the role of renin in blood-pressure control. For their latest investigation, they worked with UVA senior scientist Jason P. Smith, PhD, and collaborators to better understand how certain cells can suddenly remember how to make renin long after they have stopped doing so.\\n\\nThe UVA team identified several biological mechanisms involved in this transformation. For example, the researchers identified nine genes that play key roles in the three biological \\\"pathways\\\" that regulate renin production. These genes are responsible for causing smooth muscle cells to stop producing renin and for triggering them to resume when needed. The scientists note that while such cells stop producing renin naturally, they remain \\\"poised\\\" to jump back into action.\\n\\nFurther, the scientists discovered factors that trigger the genes to resume renin production. This \\\"epigenetic\\\" switch is the lynchpin to understanding how renin production is controlled in these cells that don't normally produce renin.\\n\\n\\\"We expected to find the region in your genome where this gene is located to be inaccessible when renin is turned off, but it turns out this spot stays generally accessible in cells that are ready to be called into action when more renin is needed,\\\" Smith said. \\\"Ultimately, since renin is so critical for our own health, a better understanding of how our bodies control its production may prove foundational to how we treat hypertension [high blood pressure] and the long-term effects of common blood pressure medications on kidney function and disease.\\\"\\n\\nThe UVA researchers' work provides a comprehensive map of this form of renin regulation, they note in a new scientific paper. The findings give important direction to future research, they say, and could provide important insights into the progression of dangerous kidney damage called fibrosis. It's possible, they say, that targeting the renin-control processes could lead to new treatments for high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.\\n\\n\\\"Now we want to identify markers and potential targets to mitigate and hopefully control unwanted effects of chronic stimulation of the renin cells,\\\" Sequeira-Lopez said. \\\"It is crucial to understand the basic secrets of our cells to design more and more effective therapies with less or no adverse effects.\\\"\\n\\nThe research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, grants P50DK096373, R01DK116718 and R01HL148044.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"sciencedaily.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"ScienceDaily\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Science/Biology/Cryobiology\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Science/Biology/Cryobiology\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Science/Biology/Biotechnology\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Science/Biology/Biotechnology\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel_Cells\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel Cells\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Health\",\"label\":\"news/Health\",\"wgt\":85}],\"image\":\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9942439\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":4},\"sentiment\":0.1294117647058823,\"wgt\":465091230,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338877980\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:30\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:30Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-26T23:59:31Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://newsday.co.tt/2024/09/26/opposition-leader-persad-bissessar-improve-lives-of-soldiers/\",\"title\":\"Opposition Leader Persad-Bissessar: Improve lives of soldiers -

(AP) -- Alabama used nitrogen gas Thursday to execute a man convicted of killing three people in back-to-back workplace shootings, the second time the method that has generated debate about its humaneness has been used in the country\\n\\nAlan Eugene Miller, 59, was pronounced dead at a south Alabama prison. He shook and trembled on the gurney for about two minutes with his body at times pulling against the restraints. That was followed by about six minutes of gasping breathing.\\n\\nMiller was convicted of killing three men -- Lee Holdbrooks, Christopher Scott Yancy and Terry Jarvis -- in 1999 and the state had previously attempted to execute him by lethal injection in 2022.\\n\\nThe execution was the second to use the new method Alabama first employed in January, when Kenneth Smith was put to death.

Trial testimony indicated that Miller was paranoid and believed his co-workers had been gossiping about him.\\n\\n\\\"You've been spreading rumors about me,\\\" a witness described Miller as saying before he opened fire. All three men were shot multiple times.\\n\\nMiller had initially pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity but later withdrew the plea. A psychiatrist hired by the defense said that Miller was mentally ill but his condition wasn't severe enough to use as a basis for an insanity defense, according to court documents. Jurors convicted Miller after 20 minutes of deliberation and recommended by a vote of 10-2 that he receive the death penalty.\\n\\nIn 2022, the state called off the previous attempt to execute Miller after being unable to connect an IV line to the 351-pound (159-kilogram) inmate. Miller had initially challenged the nitrogen gas protocol but dropped his lawsuit after reaching an undisclosed settlement with the state.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"yakimaherald.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Yakima Herald-Republic\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"associated_press@yakimaherald.com\",\"name\":\"Associated Press\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":true},{\"uri\":\"kim_chandler@yakimaherald.com\",\"name\":\"Kim Chandler\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Appraisal_and_Valuation\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Appraisal and Valuation\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Business\",\"label\":\"news/Business\",\"wgt\":53}],\"image\":\"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/yakimaherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/18/b1872abd-2226-54a7-b726-afd41fec6c5d/66f5be2356ae5.image.jpg?crop=1661%2C872%2C0%2C187&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":-0.6313725490196078,\"wgt\":465091235,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338877928\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:35\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:35Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-26T23:59:28Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/election-film-baking/prop-33-34\",\"title\":\"Election 2024: Your guide to CA Props 33, 34 | Press Play\",\"body\":\"As election season ramps up, two propositions on the 2024 California ballot are making voters scratch their heads. Prop 33 would expand rent control in the state, but it's sponsored by an organization that isn't widely known as a housing advocate: the LA-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The measure, however, has sparked pushback from California's landlord lobby in the form of Prop 34. The initiative is billed as a health care reform measure, but its real motive appears to be to cut off funding for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\\n\\nWhat exactly is Prop 33?\\n\\nThis initiative would allow cities to expand their local rent control rules to cover more apartments and homes.\\n\\nIt does that by repealing a 1995 state law called the Costa-Hawkins Rental Act, which currently prevents cities from regulating rents on certain properties, like single-family homes and new housing.\\n\\nProp 33 would also let cities pass tougher rent control laws, including limits on how much landlords can raise their rents each time a tenant moves out. That's not allowed under the current state law.\\n\\nSupporters of the law include the California Democratic Party, Unite Here Local 11, and the California Nurses Association. The LA County Board of Supervisors voted 3-1 in support of the ballot initiative.\\n\\nSo far, 51% of likely voters say they will vote for Proposition 33, according to recent polling from the Public Policy Institute of California.\\n\\nWhy is the AIDS Healthcare Foundation so interested in rent control?\\n\\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation CEO Michael Weinstein says housing efforts are an extension of the organization's overall mission, because access to housing is a major determinant of overall health. In 2017, AHF started purchasing old buildings, including single-room occupancy hotels in Skid Row -- like The King Edward Hotel and The Baltimore Hotel -- and turning them into low-income hotels.\\n\\nThis is the third time the group, which has an annual budget of around $2.5 billion, is putting this issue before LA voters. In total, the AHF has spent more than $150 million backing various ballot measures, including statewide rent control propositions in 2018 and 2020, as well as local and state measures requiring condoms in pornographic films.\\n\\nSo how does the organization have such a large budget? It provides access to medical care for approximately 2 million patients across 17 states and 47 countries. The majority of their revenue comes from a network of 62 pharmacies.\\n\\nThe AHF is also enrolled in a federal program, called 340B that allows providers that serve low-income or at-risk patients to buy drugs at a discount, bill insurance companies at full price, and use that revenue to expand their mission. The 340B law doesn't specify how exactly that revenue garnered from drug discounts must be spent.\\n\\nAHF has used some of that money to sponsor ballot measures. But the backers of Proposition 34 argue that this money should be spent on patients, not on politics.\\n\\nWhat, then, is Prop 34?\\n\\nThis initiative, billed as the \\\"Protect Patients Now Act,\\\" would require certain health care providers using that discount drug program to use at least 98% of their net drug sale revenue on what's described as \\\"direct patient care.\\\"\\n\\nBut Prop 34 only applies to 340B providers who meet some very specific conditions. They must have spent more than $100 million on things other than direct patient care in the last decade, and also own and operate apartment buildings that have been collectively cited for at least 500 health and safety violations.\\n\\nAs far as most people can tell, the only organization that meets these criteria is the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\\n\\nThe proposition is sponsored by the California Apartment Association, a lobbying group for apartment owners and managers.\\n\\nThis proposition has support from 53% of likely voters, according to recent polling from the Public Policy Institute of California.\\n\\nSo is Proposition 34 directly targeting the AIDS Healthcare Foundation?\\n\\nWhile backers of Prop 34 claim this would likely apply to a few different providers, it appears to only apply to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. AHF has dubbed Prop 34 \\\"the revenge measure.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"kcrw.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"KCRW\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Health\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Health\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Politics\",\"label\":\"news/Politics\",\"wgt\":76}],\"image\":\"https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/election-film-baking/prop-33-34/@@images/rectangular_image/page-header?v=1727390923.44\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1},\"sentiment\":0.2,\"wgt\":465091235,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878314\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:38\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:38Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:10Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.hjnews.com/sports/nation/houstons-yordan-alvarez-improving-but-isnt-sure-when-hell-return-from-sprained-right-knee/article_a11b989b-42d9-55f7-b342-b5fb7355853a.html\",\"title\":\"Houston's Yordan Alvarez improving but isn't sure when he'll return from sprained right knee\",\"body\":\"HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston slugger Yordan Alvarez is feeling better after spraining his right knee this weekend but isn't sure when he'll be able to return.\\n\\n\\\"I wish I knew what was going to happen in the next few days or had a vision for what was going to happen in the next few days,\\\" he said in Spanish through a translator. \\\"But we need to wait for the inflammation to go down and then we can go from there.\\\"\\n\\nAlvarez was injured sliding into second base on a double in the third inning Sunday.

2021.\\n\\nFashion for Relief was dissolved and removed from the register of charities earlier this year.\\n\\nIt had been set up with the aim of uniting the fashion industry to relieve poverty and

it spent was reasonable relative to the income it generated.\\n\\nIt also said it found some fundraising expenditure to be misconduct or mismanagement by the charity's trustees.\\n\\nThis included a 14,800 euro (£12,300) flight from London to Nice for transferring art and jewellery to a fundraising event in Cannes in 2018.\\n\\nIt also looked into the decision to spend 9,400 euros (£7,800) of

charity.\\n\\nThese costs included spa treatments, room service, and the purchase of cigarettes and hotel products.\\n\\nThe regulator said trustees explained that hotel costs were typically covered

method of 'look twice, forgive once' can sustain social cooperation\",\"body\":\"The theory of indirect reciprocity holds that people who earn a good reputation by helping others are more likely to be rewarded by third parties, but widespread cooperation depends on agreement about reputations. In most theoretical models examining how reputations impact people's desire to cooperate with one another, reputations are binary -- good or bad -- and based on limited information. But there is a lot of information available about people's behavior in today's world, especially with social media.\\n\\nBiology professors Joshua B. Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania and Corina Tarnita of Princeton University lead teams that have been collaborating on theoretical research about cooperation. Sebastián Michel-Mata, a doctoral student in Tarnita's lab, came up with the idea of addressing how to judge someone in an information-rich environment.\\n\\n\\\"The current theory of indirect reciprocity suggests that reputations can only work in a few societies, those with complex norms of judgment and public institutions that can enforce agreement,\\\" Michel-Mata says. But, as an anthropologist, he sees that such societies are the exception and not the rule, and he wondered about the simple idea that reputations are summaries of multiple actions.\\n\\n\\\"Prior models have typically assumed that a single action determines someone's reputation, but I think there's more nuance to how we assign reputations to people. We often look at multiple actions someone has taken and see if they are mostly good actions or bad actions,\\\" says Mari Kawakatsu, a postdoctoral researcher in Plotkin's lab.\\n\\nThrough mathematical modeling, the research team showed that looking at multiple actions and forgiving some bad actions is a method of judging behavior that is sufficient to sustain cooperation, a method they call \\\"look twice, forgive once.\\\" Their findings are published in Nature.\\n\\nThis builds on previous work Plotkin led about indirect reciprocity. For example, he worked with Kawakatsu and postdoctoral researcher Taylor A. Kessinger on a paper calculating how much gossip is necessary to reach sufficient consensus to sustain cooperation.\\n\\nPlotkin says of the new paper, \\\"Even if different people in a society subscribe to different norms of judgment, 'look twice, forgive once' still generates sufficient consensus to promote cooperation.\\\" He adds that this method maintains cooperation without gossip or public institutions, which confirms the original hypothesis that Michel-Mata, first author on the paper, had that public institutions are not a prerequisite for reputation-based cooperation. It also offers an important alternative when public institutions exist but erosion of trust in institutions inhibits cooperation.\\n\\nKessinger says that, as in the paper about gossip, the game-theoretical model here is a one-shot donation game, also known as a simplified prisoner's dilemma. Each player can choose to help or not help their partner, and players will periodically update their views of each other's reputations by observing each other's interactions with other players, to see if the partner cooperates or \\\"defects\\\" with others. More periodically, players update their strategies.\\n\\nThe idea of indirect reciprocity is \\\"not that I'm nice to Mari because she was nice to me; it's that I'm nice to Mari because she was nice to Josh, and I have a good opinion of Josh,\\\" Kessinger says.

With quick and athletic forwards more than a little overpowered in-game, it's hardly surprising that we seem so many outlandish scorelines.\\n\\nIf you want to be on the right side of these rollercoaster affairs, you need the slickest sharpshooters the game has to offer in your squad. Whether playing Ultimate Team or Career Mode, these guys are the real game-changers.\\n\\nHere are the ten best strikers in EA FC 25.\\n\\nWhile classified primarily as a RW on this year's game, eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi still has ST as an alternate position. The Inter Miami forward is no longer at the peak of his fantastical powers, but he's 88-rated with some formidable stats.\\n\\nThe diminutive Argentine is probably most useful as a CAM - another alternate position of his - given his 79 pace, but he could act as an impressive false nine while leading the line due to his remarkable passing, shooting and dribbling.\\n\\nNo matter the league, no matter the arena, Robert Lewandowski is destined to score goals. The Poland international continues to fire home frequently for Barcelona and his 88 rating in EA FC 25 is justified following another impressive scoring season in 2023/24.\\n\\nPace (75) is an issue when it comes to online play but if Lewandowski picks the ball up within 35 yards of the opposition goal, he remains a concerning threat with 88 shooting.\\n\\nSimilarly to Lewandowski, former Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg is a little on the slow side within the adrenaline-fuelled arena of Ultimate Team, but with women's football coming to Career Mode, the Norway striker will be a popular choice for managers.\\n\\nThe Lyon striker was prolific again last season as the French side reached the Champions League final and her 89 shooting reflects her ability to consistently find the back of the net with relative ease.\\n\\nHegerberg and Portland Thorns striker Sophia Smith may both be 89-rated, but they're vastly different centre-forwards in EA FC 25. Pace (93) is certainly not an issue for the United States star, whose 86 shooting, 89 dribbling and 84 physical makes her game-breaking.\\n\\nAlso capable of playing on the right wing, Smith is ideal as an advanced forward in this year's game, and you'll score plenty by launching lofted through balls over the opposition defence in her general direction.\\n\\nLautaro Martinez's stellar 2023/24 season which saw him win Serie A and the Copa America - scooping the top scorer award in both competitions - sees the Argentine handed an upgrade in this year's game. He's now 89-rated off the back of a relentless year in front of goal.\\n\\nThe Inter striker is an all-rounder in the final third on EA FC 25, with average pace beefed up by exceptional shooting and great dribbling. Four-star weak foot and skill moves are an added bonus.\\n\\nAn anterior cruciate ligament tear ruined Sam Kerr's 2023/24 campaign but she still claimed the Women's Super League title with Chelsea. However, despite missing out on the Summer Olympics in Paris, her 90 overall rating remains untouched in this year's game.\\n\\nThe Australian forward's stats are unchanged apart from a downgrade on her physical, with her powerful play style making her a handful in EA FC 25.\\n\\nHarry Kane took no time adjusting to new surroundings following a move to Bayern Munich in 2023 and the England skipper finished his debut season with the club by scoring an astonishing 44 goals in just 45 matches. The fact that he somehow ended up without his first trophy yet again beggars belief.\\n\\nHowever, his bad luck has not impacted his EA FC rating, with the 90-rated striker still one of the most lethal in the game. While his 65 pace could prove prohibitive, his game-high 93 shooting makes up for it.\\n\\nWhile classified as a LW on EA FC 25, Vinicius Junior can also feature up front in-game. The Brazil and Real Madrid superstar exhibited his ability to lead the line in 2023/24, doing so regularly en route to Champions League and La Liga glory in a 4-3-1-2 set-up.\\n\\nThe forward's astonishing 95 pace makes him a tempting proposition up top, even if he's better-suited to playing out wide. He's seen his shooting, passing and dribbling all upgraded this year.\\n\\nFootball's most devastating finisher at present, Erling Haaland was unable to replicate his freakish debut season numbers in 2023/24. He made a pretty good fist of it, however, netting 38 times in 45 appearances as injuries impacted his total tally.\\n\\nThe Norwegian sharpshooter still won the Premier League and the competition's Golden Boot, with his speed, power and finishing ability transferring nicely to EA FC.\\n\\nMatching Haaland's 91 overall rating is Real Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe. Finally donning the Spanish side's fabled white jersey, the French forward has made a quick start to life in the capital following his move from Paris Saint-Germain over the summer.\\n\\nDestined to achieve great things at the Santiago Bernabeu, Mbappe will prove an incredibly expensive acquisition on EA FC. There will be no free transfers here, but just imagine partnering him with Vinicius Junior up top.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"ca.sports.yahoo.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Yahoo Sports Canada\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":100}],\"image\":\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SFuM5rQNxGb0DvHfj3jBLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/90min_articles_646/02a907803e1eb7f1fdeced5e0b20a70e\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.2549019607843137,\"wgt\":465091245,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878188\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:48\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:48Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-26T23:59:55Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.772549033164978,\"url\":\"https://www.si.com/nfl/cowboys/news/dallas-cowboys-new-york-giants-week-4-inactives\",\"title\":\"Dallas Cowboys at New York Giants, Week 4 inactives\",\"body\":\"Kickoff between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants on Thursday Night Football is right around the corner as Week 4 of the 2024 NFL regular season gets underway in primetime.\\n\\nDallas is desperate for a win after dropping two straight at home, so they will look to continue their trend of owning the Giants going.\\n\\nUnfortunately, they will have to do so with a depleted secondary.\\n\\nAhead of Thursday night's kickoff, the inactives were announced with starting cornerback Caelen Carson inactive for the game with a shoulder injury.\\n\\nA full look at the Cowboys vs. Giants inactives can be seen below.\\n\\nKickoff between the Cowboys and Giants at MetLife Stadium is set for 8:15 p.m. ET on Prime Video.\\n\\n-- Enjoy free coverage of the Cowboys from Dallas Cowboys on SI --\\n\\nNFL Power Rankings after Week 3: How far did the Cowboys fall?\\n\\nCowboys vs. Giants, NFL Week 4: betting odds & preview\\n\\nCowboys vs. Giants: 3 keys to a Thursday night primetime victory\\n\\n3 Dallas Cowboys to start in fantasy football vs. Giants\\n\\nCowboys at Giants Week 4 injury report: 2 DBs are doubtful\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"si.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Sports Illustrated\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":60}],\"image\":\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2651,h_1491,x_2294,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cowboys_country/01j8r934g0a7wvw1d31r.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9933525\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1},\"sentiment\":-0.0117647058823529,\"wgt\":465091248,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878455\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:49\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:49Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:27Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.4588235318660736,\"url\":\"https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/9/26/24255240/kevin-lee-doesnt-understand-why-ufc-passed-on-contender-series-offer-i-think-it-wouldve-been-big\",\"title\":\"Kevin Lee doesn't understand why UFC passed on Contender Series offer: 'I think it would've been big'\",\"body\":\"Kevin Lee is willing to take the road less traveled to get back into the UFC, or a major MMA promotion -- which included offering to compete on Dana White's Contender Series.\\n\\nAs Lee said in a past interview with Anik & Florian, the UFC denied his request, and now, the one-time interim UFC lightweight title challenger has two fights on the books. First up, his MMA return this Saturday when he faces Thiago Oliveira at Lights Out Championship 17 in his home state of Michigan. The bout marks Lee's first fight since a 55-second stoppage loss to Rinat Fakhretdinov at UFC Vegas 76 in July 2023.\\n\\nWhen asked why the Contender Series thought didn't come to fruition, Lee still seemed a bit surprised.\\n\\n\\\"I think it [made] sense,\\\" Lee told MMA Fighting. \\\"I don't know exactly what the problem is. I honestly don't know. It's not the numbers, right? I've heard Dana kind of brag about Belal Muhammad when he wrapped the belt around him and he bragged that he got more views than any other champion -- and it was like 20 million views or something. But my brother [former fighter-turned-famous food vlogger Keith Lee] did a small video for me getting ready for my last fight in the APEX and, keep this in mind, this is a prelim APEX card fight, and my brother did a post and he got 12 million views compared to a champion that did 20 million views and Dana's bragging about it, so I don't think that's the issue.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think the issue is me not willing to show up and put on great fights because that's all I've ever done. Honestly I can't point to what the issue is. I don't know. I offered to do that fight. I think it would have been big. I think it would have been great for Dana White's Contender Series, but the offer is off the table at this point. I offered it. They said no, we'll move on. No sweat off my brow.\\\"\\n\\nLee now heads back to the regional MMA scene to face Oliveira, and less than two months later, the 32-year-old debuts for Jorge Masvidal's Gamebred Bareknuckle MMA promotion in Biloxi, Miss., at their eighth event, where he fights Saul Almeida.\\n\\nFor \\\"The Motown Phenom,\\\" the booking with Almeida happened quickly, and he couldn't say yes fast enough.\\n\\n\\\"Anybody who is a professional fighter knows having that date really sets the training in motion,\\\" Lee explained. \\\"It really kind of gives you a sense of purpose almost. I've been fighting for a long, long time, so it's not like I'm hung up on fighting for the UFC. That's where I built my career and I feel like I've given a lot to the company, but if that's not what's next, then that's not what's next. I'll fight somewhere else.\\n\\n\\\"And that's what I'm going to do and maybe it is a part of it that I got to show my worth to them still. It's a little crazy to say that at this point in my career given how much I've actually done for the company. But I think I'm very opinionated, and I think that may have rubbed Dana the wrong [way] a few times. I made some comments about the APEX, and I guess that may be [something that bothered him]. But listen, this is what I do. This is part of being me. If people ask me a question, I give them a true and honest answer. And at the same time, I've never done anybody wrong in this industry -- from media guys, to publicists, the PR, everybody in the backstage of the UFC, I feel like everybody I've touched, I've done right. So at the end of the day I hold my head up, we fight this next fight on Saturday.\\\"\\n\\nThe journey back to where Lee feels he belongs in the current pantheon of the sport begins this weekend. On paper, Lee would certainly be a heavy favorite against the 30-fight pro in Oliveira, but that doesn't mean there's a lot of weight on his shoulders in regards to where the result may take him.\\n\\n\\\"A little more relaxed, but at the same time, there's still a ton of pressure when I go back home and I'm not a world champion,\\\" Lee said. \\\"Yeah, sure, I fought for a belt, but I'm not a world champion. So I feel like I still have a lot left to prove, and yeah there's a ton of pressure. With experience comes a little bit more relaxation. With experience comes like, 'OK, I just know how these feelings go, and I know how to control them.' But there's a ton of pressure and I'm definitely feeling it for this fight.\\n\\n\\\"I'm going to whoop his ass. I'm going to show there's levels to the fight game, and at the end of the day, I'm going to show that I'm back and I'm healthy, and I'm ready to compete at 155 pounds. I know this fight is at 170, but that's because of the short notice. I'm coming back, I'm ready to compete at 155 pounds, and [show] I can still compete with the best of the 155 pounders.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"mmafighting.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"MMA Fighting\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"mike_heck@mmafighting.com\",\"name\":\"Mike Heck\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":88}],\"image\":\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G0LOy2FFxJDYYFIHSGdlUrU7GnE=/0x19:3860x1949/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25644530/1212442187.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9933284\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":5},\"sentiment\":0.0117647058823529,\"wgt\":465091249,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878061\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:49\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:49Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-26T23:59:42Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.5686274766921997,\"url\":\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-s-forces-still-have-resources-to-invade-lebanon-despite-war-in-gaza-analysts-say\",\"title\":\"Israel's forces still have resources to invade Lebanon, despite war in Gaza, analysts say\",\"body\":\"JERUSALEM - Despite fatigue among its ranks and diminished stockpiles after nearly a year of war, the Israeli military still has the capacity to launch an invasion of Lebanon, having wound down its military operations in the Gaza Strip in recent weeks, security experts said.\\n\\n\\\"Israel has sufficient resources to undertake a ground invasion,\\\" said Brig-Gen Yaacov Ayish, former commander of the Israeli military's operations directorate. \\\"Nobody wants a war, but this is a war that has been imposed on us.\\\"\\n\\nFor just under a year, Israel has been fighting Hamas in Gaza, in an effort to dismantle the militant group after it led brutal attacks on Israel on Oct 7.

But remember that it's a close election, and you know, while Colorado and Wyoming, in particular, probably aren't going to be all that close, this is another way for the national dialog and narrative to kind of find a particular example, that they can rally their base around for the Republicans, but also potentially sway some independents,\\\" he said.\\n\\nDenver Mayor Mike Johnston's office declined to comment on the billboard Thursday.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Governor Jared Polis' office, however, sent Denver7 the following statement:\\n\\n\\\"Anyone passing that sign and coming to Denver will soon find the welcoming, inclusive, vibrant city we're so proud to call home.\\\"\\n\\nAn article by the Cowboy State Daily, which was the first to report news of the billboard, states that Laramie County Sheriff Brian Kozak said he \\\"burst out laughing when he saw the billboard for the first time.\\\"\\n\\nBack in May, Sheriff Kozak chatted with Denver7 about a controversial billboard he put up, in attempt to recruit more people Denver.\\n\\nColoradans making a difference | Denver7 featured videos Roaring Fork Transportation Agency union bus drivers threaten to strike over wages, benefits More than just meals: Culinary students gain hands-on experience at Food Bank of the Rockies City of Denver to update nearly 20-year-old plan in hopes of reimagining downtown Study finds multiple pollution sources in Denver's Elyria-Swansea, Commerce City RTD reform: State lawmakers questioning agency about issues with ridership\\n\\nDenver7 is committed to making a difference in our community by standing up for what's right, listening, lending a helping hand and following through on promises.

His goal for \\\"Vindicating Trump\\\" is to present a different view of Trump's character and presidency -- a perspective he hopes more Americans will come to appreciate.\\n\\n\\\"I think Trump is aware that he represents something bigger than himself. He is conscious of that,\\\" D'Souza said. \\\"I think he feels that his destiny is, in a sense, incomplete, and that's part of what's driving him.\\\"\\n\\nRead an abridged and lightly edited transcript of our conversation below or watch the full interview above.\\n\\nRob Bluey: You have called this your most urgent and important piece of work. Now, that's saying quite a lot, given the extensive body of filmmaking that you've done. Why?\\n\\nDinesh D'Souza: It's partly a reflection of the precarious state of the country. It's partly because we have this larger-than-life figure, Trump, and not only is he someone that inspires this kind of antagonism on the other side, but he also brings out ambivalence among some conservatives and Republicans. And so often people say to me things like, \\\"Well, I don't really like the guy, but I like his policies,\\\" or, \\\"He needs to keep his mouth shut.\\\"\\n\\nWhat they're really getting at is they want a new and different Trump. They want to remake Trump in some way. Now, first of all, leaving aside the impracticality of trying to do that, I don't think we need to do it. And the reason is that Trump is a package, and he's a kind of a coherent package. And it's kind of like saying, in the Civil War, the same qualities that made General Grant a good fighter on the battlefield made him cuss a lot and made him a heavy drinker. So you can't say, \\\"Pull him off the battlefield. He cusses. He's a heavy drinker,\\\" because that's part of what makes him effective.\\n\\nSimilarly with Trump, even the things that we think of as his bad qualities, like his massive egotism, which he admits to, in fact, he's one of the few people I've ever seen who's made an actual defense of egotism. Egotism is really necessary to do anything great. He goes, \\\"If you don't have an ego, you're going to be discouraged and give up halfway down the track.\\\"\\n\\nTrump is a unique character. I wanted to bring out aspects of Trump in this film that are not often seen in the public stage, and the reason they're not seen is Trump is conditioned out of kind of manly strength to not exhibit feelings, never show vulnerability, and in some ways not even reveal his thought process. So I was eager to set him up in such a way that people could see the tumblers of his mind working and understand how he processes information.\\n\\nRob Bluey: One of the things that struck me was the beginning. You show a series of clips, a montage, beginning with Jay Leno and other appearances that Trump made prior to entering politics, so going back to his time as a New York businessman, a celebrity, a host of \\\"The Apprentice,\\\" things of that nature. But you say that there was that fateful moment when he crossed the political Rubicon, I believe was your language, in June of 2015, descending from those escalator steps at Trump Tower. What was it about that moment that changed in people's minds about Trump?\\n\\nDinesh D'Souza: Let's think of that iconic moment. Of course, it's in the film, but most people know it. Trump is at the top of the escalator, and imagine that up there is the cultural elite. Trump, himself, is probably the biggest brand of them all, but there he is with Oprah and Ellen DeGeneres and Charlie Rose and Larry King, and he's one of them, and the rappers aspire to be like him. So he's almost the embodiment of American success, Trump. And then he does something very striking, and that is he descends, he goes down. Now where does he go down to?\\n\\nTry to imagine at the bottom of the escalator the forgotten American, so not the guy who's doing real well, but the guy who feels like the economy's bypassed me, my jobs have all gone abroad, no one cares about me, neither party's paying enough attention to me. Trump basically says, \\\"OK, I'm going to take up your cause. I'm going to join your team.\\\"\\n\\nSo you can understand, just in this little image, the fact that all these people go, \\\"Wow!\\\" Well, you know what? He didn't have to do that. He's a billionaire. He's actually not one of us, but he's taking up our cause, so that's why they're so loyal to him. At the same time, think of it now from the point of view of the cultural elite. This guy used to be on our team. He's now joined with the pitchfork people down there, he's taking up their cause against us. So here we see in a nutshell how the same people that once revered him turned against him. They see him as a traitor to their class, a traitor to their group, and they'll never forgive him.\\n\\nRob Bluey: And your film goes from that moment where Trump is descending, and then you depict what it's like to be a news executive. And their reactions, you show what the scene may have been like at the Democratic National Committee, what it might've been like at the attorney general's office. So why was it important for you to reenact these moments, going back to 2015 and other moments throughout Trump's time in the spotlight?\\n\\nDinesh D'Souza: We have reenactments running through the film, and they're a distinctive aspect of my filmmaking, because there is a documentary style that is, I would call it super basic. And that is, you do some interviews, you pull some stock footage, you string it together and you've got a film, but you can't put that kind of film in the theater.\\n\\nA movie is an experience, and a good documentary film will have a lot of the elements of a feature film. It will have characters, humor, suspense, kind of a narrative arc, a climax, all of that. And now, so I said to myself, what is the thing that many of us know is happening but we never see? We never see what actually happens in the intelligence agencies. We never see what happens, for example, at the New York Times or CNN.\\n\\nImagine the scene where they're announcing that Trump is convicted of multiple felonies, right? Do the reporters of the New York Times watch this with a kind of equanimity and go, \\\"That's an important news story I've got to cover tomorrow,\\\" or are they high-fiving each other, \\\"We got him! We got him! Maggie Haberman, great job!\\\" So what we do is we imaginatively recreate these Democratic National Committee, the sort of voter activism, the media, the intelligence agencies. Nick Searcy, who's a very accomplished character actor, plays kind of the head of the intelligence apparatus. And all of this allows people to see the story of Trump told within the context of a movie.\\n\\nIt's also the kind of thing, by the way, that Trump himself appreciates, because I remember at the premiere for 2000 Mules at Mar-a-Lago, he had seen the film before. So he actually knew the content of the film, he had sort of digested that. But the second time he saw it, he was constantly commenting on the film itself, like, \\\"The music, Dinesh, where do you get music from? Do you buy music? Do you have a guy who composes the music?\\\"\\n\\nAnd he'd be like, \\\"Your voice, Dinesh,\\\" he's like, \\\"you have a movie voice. Did anyone ever tell you that? You have a movie voice, and it's a good thing you have a movie voice, because if you didn't have a movie voice, you'd have to hire someone else to narrate your films,\\\" so stuff that makes me chuckle, but I realize, wow, this guy is a cultural figure and he's interested in the way that cultural products and artifacts, like movies, are made.\\n\\nRob Bluey: That's very true. And I think one of the things that you've obviously experienced in your interactions with him is getting to know him and who he is as a person, and you attempt to bring that out in the film. I do like that unique style that you do bring to your documentaries. I think it sets you apart and you've proven that in your body of work.\\n\\nIn addition to interviewing Trump for this film, you also spoke to his daughter-in-law and one of his attorneys. What can you tell us about Donald Trump that we might not know after all of these years, and including the last decade, basically, in the public spotlight?\\n\\nDinesh D'Souza: I'll tell you an anecdote that is true and was sort of the inspiration for the way I interviewed Trump. And in fact, my wife, Debbie, warned me. She's like, \\\"You have 45 minutes with Trump, Dinesh, but you realize you're going to get two questions in, right, because this guy's going to take off and he's just going to do a monologue.\\\" And I said, \\\"No, I can't have that happen. I'm not going to allow that to happen. I have to structure it in such a way that it doesn't happen like that.\\\"\\n\\nAnd why? Well, when I got my presidential pardon, this was obviously after my campaign finance troubles with the Obama administration, I met Trump for the first time. I didn't know Trump. I'm not like a long-time, early Trumpster or anything like that, 2019, in the Oval Office. And Debbie, my wife, said to Trump, she goes, \\\"I don't understand you. You get flayed on every platform, every moment of every day. A normal person couldn't take that. Does it get to you?\\\"\\n\\nNow, quite honestly, Debbie and I both expected Trump to go, \\\"Ha ha ha. No, it doesn't get to me. These people are idiots, they're crazy. I enjoy it,\\\" that kind of thing. But he paused and he goes, \\\"Well, guys, I have to admit that there are times it really gets to me.\\\" He, goes, \\\"I'm doing this for the country.\\\" He goes, \\\"I got al-Baghdadi,\\\" and he goes, \\\"and even on that, they won't give me any credit for that.\\\"\\n\\nWe sensed a vulnerability in Trump, and as we left, we said to ourselves, and my wife said, she said, \\\"It's a pity that Trump doesn't put that aspect of himself on display for the American people to see,\\\" but I think Trump is such a man's man that he doesn't like to do that. Even when Dr. Phil interviewed him, Dr. Phil tried, as a psychologist, you know, \\\"The assassination, how did it make you feel?\\\" Well, Trump hates that kind of question and absolutely refused to go there.\\n\\nBut I wanted to bring out some aspects of Trump's personality, the kind of normalcy of the man, which the press, I think, willfully misunderstands. Trump is a bit of a jokester. So, when he says, \\\"I'm going to be a dictator for a day,\\\" I mean, who can actually take that seriously, being a dictator, and yet it's used as exhibit A in the evidence that he really will be a dictator and will never leave.\\n\\nI put those sorts of questions to Trump. I go, \\\"You troll people with these memes, Trump '28, Trump '32, Trump '36,\\\" I go, \\\"Well, are you going to leave? Are you going to be like the guy in the Western who takes care of the gangsters and then rides off into the sunset, or are you planning to kind of stay?\\\" And having Trump respond to these things, I think, will be very interesting and engaging for the audience.\\n\\nRob Bluey: I agree. You saw some of this on display at the Republican National Convention when there was a big effort to introduce his extended family, the grandkids, to the American people, but you said that Trump being a man's man doesn't necessarily gravitate toward that approach.\\n\\nDo you think that that might benefit him, though, with some of those voters who remain skeptical about him as a person?\\n\\nDinesh D'Souza: I was trying to think to myself who has been a figure, that I can think of, that on the one hand has people who are so loyal to him they would take a bullet for him, and on the other hand, have people who at least secretly wish that somebody else would put a bullet in him, right? That's not a normal situation. You wouldn't say that that would be true of Reagan, even of Jimmy Carter.\\n\\nYou have to go all the way back to Abraham Lincoln to find that kind of divide. Now, the difference between Lincoln and Trump is that in Lincoln's case, the divide was not over him, it was not over the man. It was over the issue, it was over slavery, it was over the divide in the country, over that. With Trump, it is over the man, and therefore, in this movie, I realized we need to bring out Trump the man. I cannot duck that issue. This is not just about policy.\\n\\nEven Republicans who are reluctant about Trump, their hesitation is based on Trump the man, and on a kind of, I think, very one-sided and limited perception of his character. So let's talk about that for a moment, because I'll hear people say things like, \\\"Well, he's a playboy.\\\" And I say to myself, well, he was a playboy in his younger days, I think he actually admits this, but no one's saying he's a playboy now. So the most you can say about him, the worst, he's a reformed playboy. Okay, what else? \\\"He's an egomaniac.\\\" Also true.\\n\\nTrump loves praise, he loves public praise. Interestingly, in private, he's more self-deprecating. If you saw him on Gutfeld recently, you see this kind of whimsical Trump. He's not somebody who you have to keep kissing his feet and flattering the dauphin or the prince in a courtier style, not at all, not in person, but he does like public praise.\\n\\nBut in a way, I think with Trump, his egotism is a sort of protection. It's a wall. It insulates him because, again, a normal person would be just destroyed by the kind of attack that Trump gets. And then Trump's virtues, he's magnanimous.\\n\\nEven though a lot of billionaires kind of secede from the middle class, Trump doesn't do that. There's an ordinariness to him. He has a curiosity about people. You'll never get someone who's a doorman or someone who works as a waiter in one of his hotels ever say a bad word about him. He's very nice to them. He knows their family, he asks about how their kids are doing, he's that kind of a guy. He's obviously very kind and good to his family, they adore him.\\n\\nBut above all, one virtue that he has, that I want to stress, is his supreme virtue of courage, because that is a rare virtue. Aristotle says it's the highest virtue, and it's in fact the virtue that makes all the other virtues possible, because courage gives you the strength to do all the other virtues, so it's an active virtue. Trump has it in spades. I think it is a virtue somewhat lacking, by and large, in the Republican party, particularly when we're facing people who want to take away our basic liberties.\\n\\nIt's almost like we need a tough guy on our side to take on the tough-guy regime that has been mobilized against us. Trump's willing to do it, and for this reason, I think that in this hour of our country's history, he is not only the best man, in some ways he's the perfect guy.\\n\\nRob Bluey: I'm so glad you brought up the point about courage, because it is lacking among so many in the political class, I'd say on both sides of the aisle, not just exclusively Republicans, but maybe that's where we tend to see it more often on display. And I think that probably makes some of those Republican lawmakers uncomfortable, because of the things that Trump wants to do.\\n\\nI'm glad you brought up Lincoln. You have a reenactment of Lincoln in the film. You also referenced Lincoln in your interview with Trump. Does he recognize his place in history, and did he react at all to that comparison?\\n\\nDinesh D'Souza: Yeah, he does. I think he recognizes that, and this is rare for someone who has served one term, there have been a few, well, I can think of a couple of consequential one-term presidents. So, Polk, Democrat, was a president who almost single-handedly doubled the size of the country in the middle of the 19th century. Turned out it was a very consequential presidency, and so that was the case.\\n\\nI think Trump is aware that he represents something bigger than himself. He is conscious of that. He's not the kind of person who does historical analogies, comparisons, but what he likes is he likes an acknowledgment of his role on the larger, historical stage. I think he feels that his destiny is, in a sense, incomplete, and that's part of what's driving him.\\n\\nBecause think of it, if you and I were billionaires, we had eight, 10 years to live, we have grandchildren, we have Mar-a-Lago, and on the other side, we're facing a shotgun of 91 criminal charges, two assassination attempts, with potentially more to come, no normal person would go for that. You'd be like, I'm out of here, I don't need any of this, so something must be pushing this man forward, and I think, in that sense, it's love of country and it's a sense of destiny.\\n\\nRob Bluey: You talk about how he was coasting to reelection in 2020 when COVID hit. Did you sense from him that there's unfinished business that he would like to accomplish in a second term that he was not able to do as a result of what was essentially foisted upon him by China in the spring of 2020?\\n\\nDinesh D'Souza: Trump has done a lot to expose, to peel the layers off the onion, to expose the corruption in the institutions of government that we didn't know to be looking for it over there. So in fact, these are institutions that have traditionally been considered conservative.\\n\\nWe all know that the media is left-wing, Hollywood's left-wing, academia is left-wing, but I never thought the FBI was left-wing, and I never thought the CIA was left-wing, the military is left-wing, no. But nevertheless, starting, I think, in the Obama years, there was a conscious effort to remake those institutions, certainly at the top, but it affects the bottom because the people at the top recreate an incentive structure that filters all the way down.\\n\\nI think with Trump, when he came in, he thought he could trust the military. That's why he brought in John Kelly as a general. I'll bring in a general. Generals are straight shooters. He'll give it to me straight. I think Trump also thought he could trust the people in the white lab coats. I mean, we all do, right?\\n\\nYou go to the doctor, \\\"I'm going to take your appendix out. Come in next week.\\\" You never go, \\\"Well, prove it to me that my appendix is defective. Show me some pictures so I can just make up,\\\" no. You're like, \\\"Well, I agree. Yeah, I'll take these tests. Yeah, you can go ahead and do this.\\\"\\n\\nThis implicit trust in the health authorities, I don't think any of us really dreamed that that could be ideologically manipulated, but now we know that it blatantly was. I think Trump knows also, and I think Trump realizes that, in the second term, he's got to realize that the serpents are more numerous and their dens are deeper than we had previously suspected.\\n\\nRob Bluey: I suspect that you'll see a much-heightened focus on the people who get those political jobs, whom he entrusts to carry out his agenda, based on his experiences. We're talking to Dinesh D'Souza, who has a new film out this Friday called Vindicating Trump.\\n\\nDinesh, you talked earlier about how in our country you have an alarming number of opponents of Trump. A recent poll put it at 28% of Democrats said the country would be better off if Trump had been assassinated after the second attempt. On the other side, you have many MAGA Republicans or other conservatives who believe he's the only hope that we have to save our constitutional republic.\\n\\nHow can we live in a country where people hold such diametrically opposing views?\\n\\nDinesh D'Souza: I think the problem is serious, but it is not quite as bad as we think for this reason. The people on the Trump side, on the Republican side, are making a balanced judgment about Trump because they're exposed to Trump, they're exposed to the defenses of Trump, and they're also exposed to the criticism of Trump, because none of us can avoid the mainstream media in our lives.\\n\\nWe see it. We know about it. But now look at the other side, and I'm talking here about the rank-and-file Democrat. The rank-and-file Democrat does not actually know a lot about Trump. They do not get the pro-Trump side at all. They get a nonstop propagandistic diet of anti-Trump polemic. If CNN has a panel of 17 people, they're all anti-Trump. There may be two or three Republicans, but they're selected because they're anti-Trump.\\n\\nSo as a result, one is forgiven, because think about it, when you're an intelligent person, how do discover a fact, right? You discover a fact when you see that fact appear in multiple sources, sources that you admittedly cannot check for yourself, but you think to yourself, well, if I see it in Barnes and Noble in a book, and then there it is on PBS, there it is on the history channel, there it is and Michael Moore made a film about it, Rachel Maddow's talking about it, and here it is in the New York Times, well, it must be true, because why would all these independent people have made this up, the same thing?\\n\\nThey don't realize that it's actually more like the same bullet ricocheting off multiple walls and coming at you from different directions. You think that you're getting independent sources of information, not realizing that all these people, not that they are conspiring together, but they're more like birds in a flying formation going to Florida, all flying side by side in the same pattern.\\n\\nSo that's what I'm getting at, is I think that a film like this would be very startling for an independent or a Democrat because most of what they see about it. And the nice thing about a film is a book and an argument is about something. I'm going to tell you, let's say for example, about my life in India, but it won't give you a good idea of what that's like.\\n\\nNow imagine I show you a video. I say, \\\"That's me as a kid, and that was my room, and that's the vendor outside my door selling bananas, and there's the guy with the monkey, and he's doing tricks on the street,\\\" you'd be like, oh, wow, I get a real feeling of what it would've been like to grow up in India, let's say in the 1970s, and that's what a movie can do.\\n\\nSo the movie is like you've heard all this stuff about Trump, now here's Trump. And we're going to talk, and you're going to listen, and you're going to see stuff that runs so counter to everything you've heard about Trump that you almost want to spit up your popcorn.\\n\\nI'm thinking of ways to try to bring people who are independents, and of course for people watching, if you can go watch the movie, by the way, the website is vindicatingtrump.com. You can put your city in, it'll pull up all the theaters. There's also a book of the same title you can pre-order. But my point is, if you can bring along that grumbling, anti-Trump relative or that buddy of yours, you're like, \\\"Hey, I'll buy your ticket,\\\" I think it will have a tremendous effect.\\n\\nRob Bluey: Getting the Democrats and independents to go see your movie, I think not only might change their perspective, because they haven't been exposed to that Donald Trump that you feature in the film, but up until now, maybe they just don't have any desire to. You've given them a relatively easy way, through the 90-minute film, to get a sense of who the man really is.\\n\\nDinesh D'Souza: A film appeals to the head and the heart, and that's part of the power of a film, because I often will hear conservatives say something to the effect of, \\\"Well, the liberals do not think in a cognitively rational way, they appeal to emotion. There's no question that with Kamala Harris they're doing that. They're basically saying, \\\"Don't trust your lying eyes.\\\"\\n\\nThey're telling the American people, \\\"Don't trust your pocketbook, don't trust the prices you pay in the grocery store, don't trust your retirement account, don't even trust what you've seen and heard about Kamala Harris, because that's made you dislike her. We have a new, manufactured Kamala Harris for you right here. You should believe in our mythology about Kamala Harris.\\\"\\n\\nIt's really based upon the presumption that the ordinary guy is a real buffoon, but it's also based on the idea that the ordinary guy reacts only emotionally and not rationally. Well, the nice thing about a film is that a film operates primarily on the emotional medium, for sure.\\n\\nThat's why films have a score. If you want to know what that music is doing under the film, it is regulating your emotions as you watch the film.\\n\\nThe good news is that if you do a good job with the emotional narrative, you can pack a lot of genuine, thoughtful information in a film, but if you make the mistake of making a film that has lots of thoughtful information but doesn't have the emotional component, the film will not succeed.\\n\\nRob Bluey: Let's talk about your interview with Trump. I would imagine something like this is scheduled in advance. You had no way of knowing that you were going to sit down with him one week after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. What was it like talking to him so close to that experience? Did you notice any changes from your previous interactions with him?\\n\\nDinesh D'Souza: I did. I noticed that Trump was somewhat more measured. He seemed somewhat more reflective in the sense of now seeing his own life as maybe having some sort of a directed purpose.\\n\\nHe's reluctant, and to be honest, even Reagan was. Reagan would say things like, \\\"Well, the man upstairs,\\\" that was his reference to God. \\\"The man upstairs may not like that,\\\" things like that. And Trump, too, talks about providence in a roundabout way, but I do ask him those things, because I mean, it's not just that Lincoln, for example, had, in the second inaugural, this very powerful providential sense that you don't get in the early Lincoln, but it's that Washington and Lincoln believed that the country is part of a providential narrative.\\n\\nAnd so I posed this question directly to Trump, and I think I posed it to him at the right time. If I posed it to him at another time, he might've looked at me with a funny look like, why are you asking me that, what kind of a question is that?\\n\\nTrump normally is not in the contemplative mode. He's a doer. I mean, think of it, this is a guy who's built a big part of the New York skyline. Trump thinks operationally, like how do we get this done? Trump was at his golf course, the Doral in Miami, the thing about Trump is when he walks into the, he looks and he's like, \\\"We need to take that palm tree down. That's an obstruction to the golf course over there. I want people to be able to see people playing on the course.\\\" And so he's constantly thinking of how do I make this property better, more attractive, and that's very different than, for example, an academic way of thinking.\\n\\nAnd Charlie Rose interviewed Trump when he was facing a downturn. And Charlie Rose asked him, he goes, \\\"You've come out of this, and it was a real doldrums, and not only were you bankrupt, you owed a large amount of money. Did you ever have any doubts?\\\" Trump goes, \\\"No.\\\" He goes, \\\"Never?\\\" Trump goes, \\\"No.\\\"\\n\\nNow, see, to an academic, that is not only abnormal, that is objectionable, because the academic thinks, well, that just shows a total lack of introspection, that just shows a man who has no self-consciousness, aren't you even aware of your situation? But for Trump, if he was that way, it would shut him down.\\n\\nI think the same with the criminal trials, because I asked Trump about the criminal trials. I go, \\\"Any other guy facing three criminal charges would be, first of all, emotionally undone, but probably would've exited the race. And you not only don't exit it, but you're out there the day of your hearings and you're under a gag order, but you're having a press conference, you're lambasting the judge. You're doing your legal rope-a-dope.\\\"\\n\\nAnd Trump goes, and I think this struck me, he goes, \\\"I will just not allow myself to be bothered by it.\\\" So think about the level of self-control it takes to do that.

The workshop was a follow-up to similar stakeholder engagement meetings in Harare and Bulawayo by the Tourism ministry's national branding, communications and business development department.\\n\\nBindura Rural District Council chief executive officer, Savie Munoriarwa said there was need to tackle public and private sector corruption to rebuild the country's battered image.\\n\\n\\\"There is need to deal with corruption decisively.

Koreans shut out on opening day of Presidents Cup | Yonhap News Agency\",\"body\":\"SEOUL, Sept. 27 (Yonhap) -- All three South Korean players in action for the International Team on the opening day of the Presidents Cup failed to pick up a point, as the heavily favored United States jumped out to a 5-0 lead in Canada.\\n\\nThe all-Korean tandem of Im Sung-jae and Tom Kim lost to Russell Henley and Scottie Scheffler 3 & 2 in the third fourball match of the day at Royal Montreal Golf Club in Montreal on Thursday (local time). In the first match of the competition, South Korean An Byeong-hun teamed up with the Australian veteran Jason Day, but Tony Finau and Xander Schauffele beat them 1 up.\\n\\nThe Presidents Cup is a biennail match-play competition between the U.S. and a team of non-European international players. This is the 15th edition of the event, and the Americans have won 12 of the 14 so far, with one tie and one loss.\\n\\nIn fourball matches, players each play their own ball and the better score of the two players ends up as their team's score on each hole.\\n\\nKim, the youngest player at this year's competition at 22, had said Wednesday he wanted \\\"a revenge match\\\" against Scheffler, world No. 1 and a close friend of Kim's. In June, Kim lost to Scheffler in a playoff at the Travelers Championship.\\n\\nKim did his part, making four birdies and celebrating them with exaggerated fist pumps and shouts. But Im did not make any birdie, as the U.S. duo closed out the match on the 16th hole.\\n\\nThe match turned chippy on the seventh green, where Scheffler made a 27-foot birdie putt to match Kim's birdie and, just before the ball found the cup, turned around in Kim's direction and yelled, \\\"What was that?\\\"\\n\\nKim drained another long birdie putt on the eighth hole, and he and Im proceeded to walk to the next tee box before Scheffler stepped up to his birdie attempt. According to reports, U.S. assistant captain Kevin Kisner was bothered by the South Koreans' action and raised the issue with his International Team counterpart Camilo Villegas.\\n\\nHenley and Scheffler led 1 up through 13 holes, and then Henley birdied the 14th and 15th to put the match out of the South Koreans' reach.\\n\\nKim said afterward he was disappointed to have come up short despite playing some great golf. He also said he enjoyed trading birdies with Scheffler.\\n\\n\\\"He was being himself, and that's how we play back at home. I knew it was going to happen, and it's all fun,\\\" he said. \\\"I made it on top of him, and he gave it to me, and I gave it to him back on the next hole. I don't shy away from him. He's a good friend, but this week, I don't like him. I want to beat him so bad, and I'm sure he feels the same way.\\\"\\n\\nOn his walk to the ninth tee after making that birdie on the eighth, Kim said he and Im \\\"were focusing on our own game.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I made a putt, and whether he made it or not, it wasn't going to make a difference, and there was no reason to stay there and look at him putt. That doesn't help us at all,\\\" Kim said. \\\"And I wasn't trying to be cheap or trying to do anything like that. I'm sorry that the answer is pretty boring, but literally, it was just I made a putt. Whatever happens happens.\\\"\\n\\nIn the day's first match, Day birdied the first hole to put the Internationals ahead, before Schauffele responded with a birdie on the next hole.\\n\\nDown by two holes through 14, An's birdie and Day's par helped the International duo draw even. However, Schauffele's birdie on the 17th gave the Americans a 1-up lead, and they won the match by that margin on the next hole.\\n\\nThe three other matches all went to the U.S. side. Collin Morikawa and Sahith Theegala beat Min Woo Lee and Adam Scott 1 up. Keegan Bradley and Wyndham Clark held off Christiaan Bezuidenhout and Taylor Pendrith 1 up. Sam Burns and Patrick Cantlay then defeated Corey Conners and Hideki Matsuyama 2 & 1.\\n\\nThe Presidents Cup will continue with foursome matches Friday, with players taking turns playing one ball per team.\\n\\nThe fourth South Korean on the International Team, Kim Si-woo, is expected to see action in foursome.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"en.yna.co.kr\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Yonhap News Agency\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"yoo_jee_ho@en.yna.co.kr\",\"name\":\"Yoo Jee-ho\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Korean\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Korean\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Hapkido\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Hapkido\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":98}],\"image\":\"https://img0.yna.co.kr/photo/ap/2024/09/27/PAP20240927053801009_P4.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9941426\",\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.1450980392156862,\"wgt\":465091254,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338877094\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:00:55\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:55Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-26T23:57:59Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/national/24613104.supermarket-own-label-baked-beans-beat-well-known-brands-taste-test/\",\"title\":\"Supermarket own-label baked beans beat well-known brands in taste test\",\"body\":\"Aldi's Bramwells Baked Beans In A Rich Tomato Sauce costing 41p for a 410g can achieved a top score of 76% from 66 tasters selected by the watchdog to rate 10 versions from supermarkets such as Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco alongside their branded counterparts.\\n\\nThe panel said Aldi's beans looked good and had an appealing aroma, with three-quarters agreeing that the strength of flavour was perfect.\\n\\nBranston's beans, costing £1 for the same-sized can, followed closely behind with a score of 75%.\\n\\nCo-op's Baked Beans In Tomato Sauce at 49p for 400g can took third place with a score of 74%, while Asda's version at 42p for 410g can achieved 73%, although some of the panel were unsure about the colour of the beans and 29% found the orange hue \\\"too vibrant\\\".\\n\\nHeinz Beanz at £1.40 for a 415g can scored 72%, with the panel approving of the beans' appearance and texture but finding their aroma less pleasing than other versions, while 35% of the panel thought the sauce was too thin.\\n\\nWhich?

At the AI in Action webinar, industry leaders urged businesses to turn AI from theory into practice, emphasising strategic, ethical integration for real outcomes in today's \\\"new normal.\\\"\\n\\nIn a rapidly evolving digital landscape, AI is no longer just a buzzword - it's a critical driver of business success. In fact, 77% of businesses are already using or exploring AI technologies to enhance their operations.\\n\\nThis was the key message from industry leaders during the recent AI in Action: Driving Business Impact at Scale with Data and AI webinar, where experts emphasised the need for companies to turn AI from theory into practice.\\n\\nHosted by iTnews and powered by EXL, the event featured insights from notable figures such as Shanker Trivedi, SVP of Enterprise Business, NVIDIA, Vishal Chhibbar, EXL's EVP and Chief Growth and Strategy Officer; and former Victorian Minister for Trade, Innovation & the Digital Economy, Philip Dalidakis, who urged businesses to harness AI strategically to unlock tangible outcomes.\\n\\n\\\"Data and AI are moving at an unprecedented pace, but the focus must remain on using this technology to deliver real business value, not just riding the wave of hype,\\\" Dalidakis said.\\n\\n'New Normal' of AI\\n\\nDalidakis highlighted how the landscape for businesses has fundamentally shifted, especially in the wake of the pandemic. He noted that the accelerated adoption of digital technologies, including AI, has redefined how companies operate, compete, and engage with customers.\\n\\n\\\"Businesses can no longer afford to treat AI as a futuristic concept. It's an integral part of the new normal.\\\"\\n\\nHe explained that organisations must now focus on integrating AI into their everyday operations to stay relevant. \\\"The pandemic has shown us that agility and adaptability are non-negotiable. AI can empower businesses to make faster, data-driven decisions, optimise processes, and personalise customer experiences at scale.\\\"\\n\\nDalidakis also highlighted the importance of ethical AI in this new normal, warning against the pitfalls of rushing into AI adoption without considering its broader implications. \\\"It's not just about deploying AI -- it's about doing it responsibly. Companies need to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in their AI systems to build trust with their customers and stakeholders.\\\"\\n\\nDalidakis called for a balanced approach that embraces innovation while safeguarding against potential risks. \\\"The new normal isn't just about leveraging technology - it's about shaping a future where AI enhances business value without compromising ethical standards.\\\"\\n\\nTurning AI into 'Business Value'\\n\\nIn highlighting practicalities, EXL's EVP and Chief Growth and Strategy Officer, Vishal Chhibbar, emphasised a \\\"critical shift\\\" from theoretical discussions to practical implementation.\\n\\nHe pointed out the gap between the excitement around AI and its actual deployment in business.\\n\\n\\\"There's been a lot of talk about the potential of this technology, but not much discussion on how to put it in action. We hope to change that today.\\\"\\n\\nThis approach was central to the event, focusing on actionable insights. EXL Chairman and CEO, Rohit Kapoor, built on this by sharing EXL's strategic integration of AI into business processes.\\n\\n\\\"Our entire approach is around data and AI being leveraged together and generating true business outcomes,\\\" Kapoor said.\\n\\nHe noted that EXL has developed over 150 use cases across various industries, delivering \\\"tangible real benefits\\\" by applying AI in ways that significantly impact clients' bottom lines.\\n\\nCritical Role of Data and Expertise\\n\\nAdditionally, the importance of data as the foundation for successful AI implementation is also a recurring theme.\\n\\nKapoor emphasised that \\\"putting your data estate in order is an absolutely critical step in order to be able to take full advantage of Generative AI.\\\"\\n\\nHe also highlighted the necessity of combining strong domain knowledge with expertise in data management and AI to achieve meaningful results.\\n\\n\\\"What you need in order for all of this to be put together is a very strong knowledge on the domain, very good expertise on data management, and a strong skill set in AI,\\\" Kapoor said.\\n\\nLanguage is the New Oil\\n\\nDuring the Fireside Chat: Gen AI: Hype, Hope and Reality, Suncorp Group's Head of automation, Tim Johnson, said that while AI has been a mainstay in the insurance industry for decades, Gen AI represents a significant shift, particularly in \\\"language understanding.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Language is the new oil because we are now able to actually have machinery interpreting language and producing outcomes from that interpretation better than we ever have before.\\\"\\n\\nThis advancement, according to Johnson, is a game-changer, but he was careful to highlight that Gen AI should be integrated with other technologies to maximise its potential.\\n\\nRegarding the hype cycle, Johnson expressed confidence in the staying power of Gen AI.\\n\\n\\\"Those who believe the AI hype cycle will fade are mistaken. While some applications may seem like technology searching for a problem, the core capabilities -- like advanced language understanding -- reveal its true power and potential.\\\"\\n\\nJohnson also discussed Suncorp's approach to implementing Gen AI, noting that the introduction of powerful tools like OpenAI's models has required a shift in thinking.\\n\\n\\\"Our approach involves keeping a human in the loop for augmentation, while also enhancing our existing pipelines for tasks like next best action and predictive analysis,\\\" he explained.\\n\\nFor deeper insights, demos, and to catch the full Fireside Chat on 'Gen AI: Hype, Hope, and Reality,' listen in here.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"itnews.com.au\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"iTnews\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Work\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Work\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Management\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Management\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Technology\",\"label\":\"news/Technology\",\"wgt\":75}],\"image\":\"https://i.nextmedia.com.au/Features/Screenshot_2024-09-20_113619.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9934027\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":2},\"sentiment\":0.223529411764706,\"wgt\":465091267,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878460\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:01:07\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:07Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:28Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/business/grindhouse-cafe-opens-much-buzzed-about-highland-coffee-shop-in-former-bone-dry-bar/article_278ac368-7c32-11ef-9fff-cf69ee3cd795.html\",\"title\":\"Grindhouse Cafe opens much buzzed about Highland coffee shop in former Bone Dry Bar\",\"body\":\"Video provided in partnership with The Times, JEDtv and WJOB. Sponsored by Strack & Van Til.\\n\\nGrindhouse Cafe has opened its much buzzed about coffee ship in the former Bone Dry Bar in Highland.\\n\\nGrindhouse, known for its artisan coffees, chef-crafted sandwiches and punk rock vibe, opened at 805 Ridge Road in Highland after extensively renovating the landmark Bone Dry Bar that was previously home to Alex's Bar. The spot had been a bar and grill since at least the 1950s.\\n\\nSiblings Gabe and Kate Mauch have been keeping Griffith wired for 12 years and Whiting wire for four years. The new cafe is less than 2.5 miles north of the flagship café they first opened in downtown Griffith.\\n\\n\\\"I'm pretty sure this will be the new hub for Grindhouse, our home base,\\\" he said. \\\"Our production kitchen will always be in Griffith but this is huge for us and more conducive to a coffee shop. We'll certainly have events here and have people hanging out back here.\\\"\\n\\nPeople are also reading...\\n\\nGrindhouse opened Wednesday in Highland and will have a grand opening celebration at 7 p.m. on Oct. 4 with the bands Everything We're Not, The Region and Distants and at 7 p.m. on Oct. 5 with Wraith, Complacent and Cult Fiend.\\n\\nGrindhouse serves locally roasted coffees like Metropolis, Dark Matter, Yaggy Road, Dagger Mountain, Smugglers, Bee Coffee, Cloud Walking, Botz and Shuv. It's known for craft drink like the Shopkeeper's Daughter Cherry Mocha, Virtuoso of the Void White Chocolate Lavender, the Red Priestess Rooibos Tea Latte with Vanilla and the seasonal Cactor Frozen Pear Lemonade.\\n\\nIt offers salads and sandwiches like the Croque Grindhouse, Turkey Dolo and Blue Cheese Beef Bomb. The Highland location has the same menu as the other locations but may offer pop-up brunches or dinners with beverage pairings in the future.\\n\\n\\\"Consistency is one of the most important things in a restaurant from food to hours,\\\" he said. \\\"In my experience, if a restaurant says it's open on Tuesday and it's not open, I might try it a second time but if it's not open then I'm never going back. I want Grindhouse to be consistent at all times. When we were first starting, people would tell me the drinks tasted so much better when I was working. It was meant as a complement but it freaked me out because I wanted to ensure they tasted the same, no matter who was making them.\\\"\\n\\nThe new spot has a large back room that will host events like concerts, plant swaps, board game nights and Dungeons and Dragons. It's about 2,000 square feet with about 80 spots, including some booths in the back they bought from a restaurant auction.\\n\\nThey have extensively renovated the former bar, which retained some design elements of the former Bone Dry. It took a herculean effort to renovate, particularly to scrub the ingrained smell of cigarette smoke out of the place.\\n\\n\\\"Bone Dry was a legendary space in Northwest Indiana. I think it was the first bar to serve 3 Floyds,\\\" he said. \\\"We're making it into a big cool new space. People have said it's weird to see it during the day or weird to see it without smoke. But they loved to see what we've done with it. It's now unmistakable a Grindhouse.\\\"\\n\\nIt looks similar to the other two Grindhouses but has its own feel.\\n\\n\\\"I would say it's a Grindhouse that feels a little more grown-up,\\\" Mauch said. \\\"The Griffith Grindhouse was in high school, the Whiting Grindhouse in college and this is a Grindhouse with a college degree that's working at Target.\\\"\\n\\nHe hopes it will became an institution people frequent not only to grab a coffee but also to hang out, read, study or socialize.\\n\\n\\\"Bone Dry was loved by so many different types of people. It was a second home. That's what Grindhouse is,\\\" he said. \\\"It's a nice place, maybe not for everybody but for but a special place for Northwest Indiana. We have that in common. I'm excited to open it so world can see it. Grindhouse has grown into this big, beautiful thing beyond anything I thought it would be. I just didn't want to have a boss. Twelve years later, it's a Region institution.\\\"\\n\\nFor more information, visit grindhouse.cafe.\\n\\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Shoot, we've been playing each other ... for like 14 years.\\\"\\n\\nGodwin, meanwhile, is in a groove, according to Slay.\\n\\n\\\"He's great, man.

The sale is expected to provide financial flexibility, allowing the company to accelerate its focus on OLED technology.\\n\\nAccording to the filing, LG Display will hand over all of its stake in the plant to China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSOT), a subsidiary of Chinese home appliance giant TCL, on March 31, 2025.\\n\\nThe LCD plant consists of two divisions -- panels and modules -- each managed by different corporate entities. LG Display holds an 80 percent stake in the panel division, with the remaining 20 percent owned by Guangzhou Development District. LG Display also fully owns the module division.\\n\\nOriginally, LG Display held a 70 percent stake in the panel division but increased it to 80 percent earlier this month by acquiring a 10 percent stake from China's Skyworth for 244 billion won, aiming to expedite the sale.\\n\\nIn the filing, LG Display said it is selling the stake to \\\"improve efficiency to focus on the OLED business.\\\" The company noted that the sale would enhance its competitiveness and stabilize its financial position, but added that it is not yet in a position to disclose plans for the 2 trillion won fund raised through the sale.\\n\\nThe sale offers LG Display a chance to rebalance its position in the large LCD market, which has become oversaturated and highly competitive due to the cost advantages of Chinese rivals.\\n\\nRead MoreLG Display seeks rebound by selling Guangzhou LCD plant\\n\\nLG Display has been actively scaling down its large LCD business in recent years due to the limited potential for differentiating its products from Chinese competitors, coupled with increasing market volatility in the large LCD sector.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Chinese manufacturers place significant value on the competitiveness of large LCD panels for TVs, which continue to dominate the display market. This put LG Display in urgent need to unload its stake in the plant to focus on more strategic areas.\\n\\nWhile reducing its involvement in large LCD businesses, LG Display has been focusing on higher value-added products, such as small- and mid-sized OLED panels for IT devices. This shift allows the company to capitalize on growing demand for premium displays in sectors like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.\\n\\nIndustry officials note that while LG Display currently holds a technological advantage over competitors in the OLED sector, Chinese rivals like BOE are rapidly closing the gap through significant investments. This raises concerns that LG Display might face a similar decline in its OLED business as it did with large LCDs, where Chinese firms gained an edge through aggressive pricing and scale.\\n\\nAlthough LG Display has not disclosed specific plans for the use of the funds from the sale, the market anticipates that the money will be directed toward advancing its OLED business and supporting its financial stability.\\n\\nMeanwhile, LG Display will retain its LCD products for IT devices and automobiles. The company plans to concentrate on high-end products, emphasizing features such as low power consumption, distinctive design, and higher resolutions.\\n\\nWith LG Display's sale of the large LCD plant in Guangzhou, no South Korean company is producing large LCD panels for televisions.

(WFLA) - As Hurricane Helene churns in the Gulf of Mexico, cutting-edge technology from Saildrone, Inc. is giving us a firsthand look at the storm's incredible power. A Saildrone unmanned surface vehicle (USV), SD-1083, captured stunning video footage from inside the storm.\\n\\nOn Thursday, SD-1083 was positioned approximately 100 nautical miles north-northeast of Hurricane Helene's edge at 12:45 UTC. By 17:46 UTC, the unmanned vehicle found itself just 95 nautical miles from the hurricane's eye, experiencing massive waves and intense wind gusts. The video and data collected offer a rare glimpse of the storm's approach from the safety of an advanced drone.\\n\\nThe footage, shared courtesy of Saildrone and NOAA, shows waves reaching several meters high, while wind gusts peaked at 24.53 knots, showcasing the raw force of nature as the storm bears down. This visual documentation of the hurricane's impact is not only remarkable for its clarity but also significant in providing scientists with real-time data from inside a major storm system.\\n\\nSaildrone USVs like SD-1083 are designed to operate in the world's most extreme ocean environments. Founded in 2012 by Richard Jenkins, Saildrone has developed a fleet of unmanned ocean drones used for scientific research, ocean mapping, and environmental monitoring. Partners like NOAA, NASA, and leading research institutions around the world rely on the Saildrone fleet for data collection that was once too dangerous or inaccessible for human researchers.\\n\\nIn the case of Hurricane Helene, the footage gathered by the Saildrone will help scientists better understand the behavior of hurricanes and how they intensify. This is especially crucial as climate change continues to impact the frequency and strength of these powerful storms.\\n\\nSaildrone's unmanned vehicles have previously provided critical data for oceanic and atmospheric research, and their work in hurricane monitoring represents a breakthrough in storm prediction and safety measures. By venturing into the heart of Hurricane Helene, the Saildrone team, in partnership with NOAA, is helping to push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of storm tracking and data collection.\\n\\nAs more footage and data from SD-1083 and other Saildrones are expected over the next 24 hours, the world will have an unprecedented look at the behavior of a hurricane as it unfolds in real-time.\\n\\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

The move could be a harbinger of a bigger role coming for the former Baltimore Ravens sixth-round pick.\\n\\nSince Badie joined the Broncos, the team's PR department has provided pronunciation of his name, phonetically spelling it out as 'Bay-dee.' However, during his breakout performance last week in Tampa, the television broadcast crew pronounced his name 'Buh-day.'\\n\\nThe Broncos PR department is top-shelf, and it goes to great length to ensure that player names are pronounced correctly by announcers, commentators, and pundits, by phonetically spelling it out in the annual Media Guide. So why the discrepancy with regard to 'Bay-dee' and 'Buh-day?'\\n\\n\\\"I actually changed it myself,\\\" Badie said via Stevens. \\\"There's some other things going on, some family things that I'll talk about later on. But right now, I'm just trying to focus on football now.\\\"\\n\\nWhat happens next on the Broncos beat? Don't miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second, sign up for our free newsletter, and get breaking Broncos news delivered to your inbox daily!\\n\\nAnd there you have it. Badie himself went to the Broncos after the Media Guide had been released and told him of the pronunciation change, which is how last week's TV broadcast had it right.\\n\\nWith that out of the way, Badie wants to focus on ball, and so do Broncos fans. Now that he's been promoted to the 53-man roster, could Broncos Country expect to see Badie taking a bigger share of the rushing load? Perhaps Broncos offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi's Thursday remarks could hint at an answer.\\n\\n\\\"I think Tyler is an interesting story because he was a guy we were really excited about last year and he got hurt in training camp,\\\" Lombardi said. \\\"When he got healthy, things were kind of in motion and [we] thought he had a really good camp. We were lucky to keep him after training camp, and I think we knew that there was going to be a day this season where he was going to be called up and get his opportunities.\\\"\\n\\nWith how painful it's been to watch Williams run into his blockers' backs, and McLaughlin get quickly swallowed up by tacklers, Badie's explosive first step, and vision for finding the cut-back lane has been refreshing. It's jumped off the screen, so to speak, when studying the film -- beyond simply a change-of-pace type of impact.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think any of us were surprised at what he did,\\\" Lombardi said of Badie. \\\"He's a guy that we certainly held in high regard. I was excited when his opportunity came up. I kind of expected him to show out like he did.\\\"\\n\\nTeams are pretty stubborn when it comes to the players hand-picked to be No. 1 on the depth chart, so while the Broncos would be foolish not to find ways to include Badie more often, it'll be a surprise if it comes at the expense of Williams' touch share. There are always exceptions to the rule, but as Lombardi said in reference to last year with Badie's health, things are \\\"in motion\\\" now, and that includes Williams as RB1 in the last year of his contract.\\n\\nBroncos Country wants to see Williams -- a 2021 second-round pick whom the team traded up to draft -- succeed and even garner a second contract, but he has clearly held the offense back, which has set Bo Nix and company up for many a second- and third-and-long situations.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know if you need to do -- I don't know if there's a specific step you have to take,\\\" Lombardi said in regards to Williams and McLaughlin's low rushing averages. \\\"I mean, obviously, Tyler got in there and had the big run, and he's a guy that we really like. The run game is one of those things where not every run is going to be a 20-yard gain, and you stick with it, thinking you know the players that you have. Just because the stats tell you that they're not gaining a bunch of yards doesn't mean that they've all of a sudden turned to crap. So you just keep handing them the ball and know that we'll keep getting better, the plan will keep getting better and we'll keep blocking better. Their big runs are coming.\\\"\\n\\nAs you can see, it doesn't sound like the plan is to eat into Williams' touch share, whether it makes sense or not. If anything, expect McLaughlin's bite at the apple to diminish if the Broncos strive to give Badie an expanded role.\\n\\n\\\"It's just like anything; it's tempting when you've run the ball a few times early and you're not gaining yards and just say, 'To heck with this, we're just going to start throwing,'\\\" Lombardi explained. \\\"The run game is one of those things that if you stick with it, you're going to start busting some runs. It's just a patience thing and just getting better when we do run it.\\\"\\n\\nHead coach and play-caller Sean Payton has stayed committed to the run, even when it hasn't worked well for the Broncos. That patience paid dividends last week when Badie was inserted into the lineup in the second half, busting off a 43-yard run and helping the Broncos consume the clock and put the Bucs to bed.\\n\\nHowever, in the NFL, the hot hand typically takes precedence -- especially in a running-back-by-committee offense like Payton's. The Broncos would be remiss to ignore Badie's momentum just for the sake of keeping the original plan \\\"in motion.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"si.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Sports Illustrated\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Advice\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Advice\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":95}],\"image\":\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2026,h_1139,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/mile_high_huddle/01j8dw5te3j8574tc94r.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9948773\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1},\"sentiment\":0.1058823529411765,\"wgt\":465091277,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878507\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:01:17\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:17Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:38Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://tnp.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/strong-demand-bidadari-flats-entering-resale-market\",\"title\":\"Strong demand for Bidadari flats entering resale market\",\"body\":\"The first flats from the Bidadari housing estate have hit the resale market and analysts say the initial transactions show there is strong demand for flats in the area, especially from young couples looking to buy their first homes.\\n\\nAccording to Housing Board data, four transactions have been lodged for flats in Bidadari Park Drive. Three were four-room flats that transacted for between $937,500 and $1.17 million.\\n\\nThe remaining transaction was a 113 sq m five-room unit that was sold for $1.2 million.\\n\\nSome analysts say the prices could serve as benchmarks for other transactions in the area, while others cautioned against thinking that \\\"million-dollar\\\" transactions would be the norm for flats there.\\n\\nThe deals were among the first resale transactions from the new estate, where flats in Alkaff Vista - which comprises 199 four-room and 151 five-room flats - recently fulfilled their five-year minimum occupation period (MOP).\\n\\nBuild-To-Order (BTO) flats in Bidadari were significantly oversubscribed when launched in November 2015, with as many as 20 applicants vying for a five-room unit.\\n\\nNow that the flats can be resold, property agents and analysts say prices reflect the high demand for homes in the area.\\n\\nThey said resale buyers are keen on the units even though it is a new estate because of its convenient location on the city fringe and proximity to amenities such as MRT stations and The Woodleigh Mall.\\n\\nPropNex agent Jayden Chia said he received five offers for the 94 sq m unit in Alkaff Vista and the eventual buyers - a couple in their 30s - agreed to purchase it for $1.08 million in September.\\n\\nThe transaction has yet to be reflected on HDB's website as it takes about three months for a resale transaction to be finalised.\\n\\nMr Chia said most prospective buyers were young couples looking to buy their first home and were drawn by Bidadari's convenient location near Woodleigh and Potong Pasir MRT stations, as well as St Andrew's School.\\n\\nFour-room flats in Alkaff Vista were priced between $433,000 and $550,000 when they were launched in 2015, and five-room units went for $544,000 to $625,000.\\n\\nProfessor Sing Tien Foo, provost's chair professor of real estate at NUS Business School, said the resale prices in Bidadari were unsurprising, pointing out that new flats in other areas on the city fringe, such as Dawson, have also had high transaction prices. While Bidadari is a new estate, Dawson is located within the mature town of Queenstown.\\n\\n\\\"The strong price appreciation could be due to the high demand for areas where private housing prices could be out of reach for many average-income families,\\\" he said, citing The Woodleigh Residences condominium, which is priced above $2,000 per sq ft (psf).\\n\\nHe added that the recently transacted prices in Bidadari would prop up resale prices in the area, setting the benchmark for the estate.\\n\\nMs Wong Siew Ying, head of research and content at PropNex, said prices of the Bidadari resale flats were comparable to those of flats with a remaining lease of 94 to 95 years in Toa Payoh, a mature town.\\n\\nFour-room flats in Toa Payoh Apex, near Toa Payoh East, changed hands for $850,000 to about $1.057 million between November 2023 and Sept 17, 2024.\\n\\nMs Christine Sun, chief researcher and strategist at property firm OrangeTee Group, noted that the Bidadari transactions were recorded at prices close to or exceeding $1,000 psf, with the highest at nearly $1,200 psf, an indication of strong demand.\\n\\n\\\"This psf rate is comparable to what consumers might expect to pay for some older resale condos.\\\"\\n\\nBut she advised potential buyers to exercise caution and not assume that a \\\"million-dollar price tag\\\" was the norm for flats in Bidadari.\\n\\n\\\"The supply of flats is increasing over time, which may limit future price appreciation,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe proportion of million-dollar resale flat transactions has grown but remains small, accounting for about 2 per cent of all transactions in the past 1½ years, the Ministry of National Development said in August.\\n\\nOnly 0.5 per cent of four-room and smaller flats transacted in the past two years were sold for a million dollars or more.\\n\\nMore resale flats in Bidadari are expected to come onto the market, with the 531-unit Alkaff LakeView reaching its MOP in the coming months, and the 1,258-unit Alkaff CourtView in 2025.\\n\\nChecks on Sept 25 showed more than 40 listings for resale flats in Alkaff Vista across listing platforms such as PropertyGuru, 99.co and the HDB Flat Portal.\\n\\nMs Wong said demand will likely remain strong for flats in Bidadari. She pointed out that the new Prime, Plus and Standard flat classification, which will kick in from the BTO exercise in October, could channel interest to well-located resale flats, such as those in Bidadari, which do not have significant resale restrictions.\\n\\nFrom October, new BTO units closer to amenities like MRT stations and town centres will fall under the Prime and Plus categories. These flats will come with stricter resale conditions such as a 10-year MOP and a subsidy clawback.\\n\\n\\\"Some prospective buyers may not be willing to be subjected to these stricter conditions and the longer MOP and they may decide to buy a resale flat in attractive locations instead,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe Bidadari estate consists of 12 BTO developments across four districts - Alkaff, Bartley Heights, Park Edge and Woodleigh. The Alkaff and Woodleigh districts have been completed, with the remaining two districts set for completion by mid-2025.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"tnp.straitstimes.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"The New Paper\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Personal Finance\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Apartment Living\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Business\",\"label\":\"news/Business\",\"wgt\":74}],\"image\":\"https://tnp.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/rl680/public/ilbidadari19.aea9ce87.Attachment.101124.jpg?itok=BKn2XyGE\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.1215686274509804,\"wgt\":465091277,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878683\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:01:18\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:18Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:00:57Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.8352941274642944,\"url\":\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13896521/Giada-Laurentiis-lookalike-daughter-Jade-singing-band.html\",\"title\":\"Giada De Laurentiis, shares video of daughter Jade singing\",\"body\":\"Giada De Laurentiis shared a group of photos and video clips celebrating her summer memories on Instagram.\\n\\n'& that's a wrap for summer 2024,' she captioned the post, adding a crying emoji.\\n\\nIncluded in that group was a video of her lookalike daughter Jade Marie De Laurentiis-Thompson, 16, singing with her band, The Hours.\\n\\nJade can be seen singing lead vocals nearby a train station, possibly engaging in the tradition of busking.\\n\\nThe Food Network star - who had sinus surgery earlier this year - shares Jade with her ex-husband, fashion designer Todd Thompson.\\n\\nGiada De Laurentiis shared a group of photos and video clips celebrating her summer memories on Instagram.

Partly because Astro Bot was reminding me of a lot of classic PS1 games I used to love and partly because Dino Crisis and Legacy Of Kain are getting a comeback via PS Plus and they were two of my favourite games back in the day.\\n\\nI have no idea how they play now though and have a feeling they may not have aged well. So I ask you: what is the best PS1 game, in terms of something you could play now? I know it's not Ape Escape, which I loved in Astro Bot, because that had a bad camera and controls even back in the day. Metal Gear Solid was also fiddly even at the time and Final Fantasy 7 is so badly translated it's almost unplayable now.\\n\\nI think the better picks are probably simple action games, that don't really age, like Tekken or Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Resident Evil 2 is great, I love it, but the tank controls are so of their time. Timelessness is not something most PS1 games have but ironically it may be 2D games like Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night and Final Fantasy Tactics that have lasted the best.\\n\\nSting\\n\\nExpected answer\\n\\nIt's funny that it's their new museum that's got Nintendo talking, rather than anything to do with the Switch 2, but I can't fault Miyamoto-san on anything he said this week. I am very glad to see them take a clear stance on AI but then again, I'd be very surprised and disappointed if they had gone all in on it. Not even Xbox has done that yet, although I fear that's coming sooner or later.\\n\\nHim describing how Nintendo wasn't interesting in getting into the rat race of high-end consoles was very reassuring to here. We've seen exactly where the opposite has got us: games that are too expensive to make and consoles whose main selling points are impossible to see with the naked eye and yet cost £700.\\n\\nI'm not saying PlayStation and Xbox shouldn't try and make better graphics, but they have to show some restraint and they've shown none whatsoever. Nintendo could've made the Switch as powerful as PlayStation 4 if they decided to charge £960 for it (the price of a PS5 Pro special edition) but because they're not crazy they didn't.\\n\\nDogger\\n\\nWeird idea\\n\\nLots of Nintendo stories on Thursday but interesting stuff all round. Not surprised to hear Nintendo doesn't like AI but it's good to hear anyway. Not wanting to get involved in the console wars is also a given but also nice to hear said out loud.\\n\\nI do wonder what this wireless, possibly wearable, device is though. I agree the time limit it on it makes it sound like it's something that's going to come out early, so what is Nintendo thinking? A reader mentioned Miis the other day and this new gadget got me thinking that I'd like to see a return of something similar to StreetPass again.\\n\\nIt was very simple, but I found it very fun picking up people's Mii whenever I went out. So I wonder if this device is doing something similar? I'm sure the Switch can do the wireless stuff itself but maybe there's more complicated interactions being planned with AR or similar? Just a thought and I'm sure whatever it is it'll end up being too weird for any of us to imagine - in a good way.\\n\\nCuscus\\n\\nEmail your comments to: gamecentral@metro.co.uk\\n\\nAdvanced reading\\n\\nI'm not usually someone who gets hyped for games before they've been reviewed. But I'm making an exception for the upcoming Exodus game. Not only is it being developed by some of the staff who previously worked on Mass Effect and Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic (two of my favourite role-playing games) but it also features the voice talents of Matthew McConaughey (one of my favourite actors, particularly in Interstellar).\\n\\nMost importantly though, the developers have aquired the sci-fi writing talents of best-selling author Peter F. Hamilton (one of my favourite authors), who has not only been brought in as a creative consultant, but is writing two whole novels set in the universe he's created for the game.\\n\\nI'm currently enjoying the first of these, The Archimedes Engine, and it's up to the usual high standards of his writing, with bags of intrigue, depth, and creative world-building. It gives me certainty that the game's universe will be an interesting and unique one, and hope that we may get a better ending than that of the Mass Effect series!\\n\\nFor any fans of sci-fi (or good books in general) who might be interested in reading some of his other work, I'd recommend starting with the excellent Commonwealth Saga (Comprised of Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained) as it will probably a while before the second book to his Exodus series is finished!\\n\\nDan\\n\\nUnrequited love\\n\\nI don't know what can be said about this PS5 Pro 30th anniversary business. I'm all for calling Sony out on the price of the normal model but anyone that's paying £8,000 for the same thing but painted grey has only got themselves to blame. I've no sympathy, even if it seems that Sony didn't do anything to stop scalpers.\\n\\nBut the idea that it was £960 even before the scalpers is incredible to me. Okay if you're a millionaire and just enjoy wasting your money but ordinary people could buy 14 ordinary full price games or more for the same price. Spending that sort of money on a console to celebrate a corporate brand's anniversary... I can guarantee you Sony don't love you as much as you love them.\\n\\nMendas\\n\\nDystopian joy\\n\\nIt's all a bit doom and gloom in gaming right now, so I thought I would cheer myself up a bit by purchasing Frostpunk (a bit of irony for you there). Admittedly, I don't think I had even heard of the game until your review of the sequel but having read it I decided to check out the original, which to my luck is currently on sale on the PlayStation Store and combined with a PlayStation Stars voucher cost me all of £2. What a bargain that turned out to be (although at £2 the bar wasn't too high).\\n\\nI'm obsessed with it and time seems to no longer work the way it used to. Hours ebb away, as I do my best to keep everyone in town warm and my mind is constantly thinking of what I need to do next when I'm not playing it.\\n\\nUsually this isn't the sort of game I would play but this isn't the first time giving something different a go has paid off by following one of your recommendations. I've been here before with Crusader Kings 3, which I became equally enthralled with.\\n\\nI guess what I'm really trying to say is we could perhaps all benefit from giving something different a go whilst we wait for Sony and Microsoft et al. to sort themselves out.\\n\\nI'm going to take my own advice and give something like Paper Mario or the new Zelda game a go next.\\n\\nHappy gaming everyone.\\n\\nVanhelsing21\\n\\nGC: Our favourite letters are always those from readers who have been inspired to try something different as a result of one of our reviews.\\n\\nMarket value\\n\\n£8,000 for a PlayStation? Anyone that would pay that isn't on this planet. Hopefully, no one will buy them, then there out of pocket.\\n\\nWhat is the world coming to when someone thinks someone will pay eight times more than shop prices. But saying that, you will get some paying it which is a shame because while people are paying it they will carry on doing it.\\n\\nDavid\\n\\nNo complaints\\n\\nA couple of interesting articles today, the first is the price hike of Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition to £34.99, leading up to the more extensive than expected PlayStation 5 remaster. Evil, rip-off Sony on the surface. The article's top picture had a comment saying good graphics don't come cheap.\\n\\nYet Nintendo has spent the Switch era releasing much of the Wii U catalogue at full price with no upgrade path, like Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. So on Switch, PlayStation 3 era graphics don't come cheap. In fairness people have criticised this too, although not to the level Sony gets.\\n\\nNintendo game prices don't ever dome down, you'll probably never get their current games for less than £35. Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition has been available for £15 for years. It was also given away free by Sony during their Covid PlayStation's Play At Home initiative and that free version can be upgraded for £10. That sounds like positively decent behaviour to me.\\n\\nFor me, there's a difference to being ripped off and a company trying to be profitable and selling things at a fair price. I've no real problem with Nintendo or Sony here and feel they both offer good value on their platforms.\\n\\nThe second article was Nintendo not following the same path as high-end consoles in pushing the console price and development budget-busting graphical/performance envelope. What's sad though is Nintendo has to make this point as there's a subset of gamers who feel Nintendo's approach of releasing tech that's behind the technology curve deserves criticising.\\n\\nI'm happy both schools of thought exist and I get the best of both worlds. But I do feel the high-end console market could do with being a bit more Nintendo here and take a break from improving graphics. It's a mild pet peeve for me and feels like chasing the dragon when people say the PS5 Pro is needed, rather than a nice/unnecessary option depending on your point of view, as the base PlayStation 5 can't run the latest and greatest at 60fps on quality settings. It's an endless pursuit where you'll never be truly satiated.\\n\\nOverall though, across Xbox, PC, Switch, and PlayStation the industry offers an excellent selection of gaming goodness. One device doesn't have to be all things.\\n\\nSimundo\\n\\nInbox also-rans\\n\\nIf they do make more Legacy Of Kain games I really hope they get Amy Hennig back to write them. She made those games, with the characters and story, much more than the gameplay. I'm convinced that's why the series quickly died a death when she left.\\n\\nDusty\\n\\nI like the idea of a Shiek spin-off game, but I always thought Impa should get a bigger role too. I don't like the old grandma look they've had for in the last few games, she was much cooler as the young warrior but she hasn't been that for ages.

Although Pakistan's hydrocarbon resources are yet to be quantified, some estimates suggest that this discovery constitutes the fourth-largest oil and gas reserves in the world. However, the oil majors appear unimpressed: in July, the country's Petroleum Minister, Musadik Malik, told a parliamentary committee that no international companies were interested in offshore oil and gas exploration in Pakistan,and those in the country largely had the exit door in view. It comes down to security, and risk versus reward with Malik explaining to the committee that the cost of security is a major deal-breaker because \\\"in areas where companies search for oil and gas, they have to spend a significant amount to maintain security for their employees and assets.\\\"\\n\\nThankfully for Pakistan's neighbor, India has no such baggage. India's oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has called for oil majors to step up oil and gas exploration in the country to help cut India's reliance on imports and make affordable fuel sustainable.\\n\\n\\\"E&P offers investment opportunities worth USD 100 billion by 2030,\\\" he told a conference at Urja Varta.\\n\\nCurrently, only 10% of India's 3.36 million sq km wide sedimentary basin is under exploration. However, the country is richly endowed with fossil fuels: back in July, S&P Global Commodity Insights revealed that four largely unexplored sedimentary basins in India could hold up to 22 billion barrels of oil. In effect, lesser-known Category II and III basins, namely Mahanadi, Andaman Sea, Bengal, and Kerala-Konkan contain more oil than the Permian Basin, which has already produced 14 billion barrels of its 34 billion recoverable oil reserves.\\n\\nRelated: OPEC+ Confirms it Has No Specific Price Target For Crude Oil\\n\\nRahul Chauhan, an upstream analyst at Commodity Insights, has emphasized the potential of India's unexplored Oil & Gas sector, \\\"ONGC and Oil India hold acreages in the Andaman waters under the Open Acreage Licensing Program (OALP) and have planned a few significant projects. However, India still awaits the entry of an international oil company with deepwater and ultra-deepwater exploration expertise to participate in current and upcoming OALP bidding rounds and explore these frontier regions,\\\" he has declared.\\n\\nBig Oil Kicks Off India Exploration\\n\\nIndia boasts significant discoveries in the Krishna-Godavari, Barmer, and Assam basins, but exploration in other areas has been slower to develop. Of India's 3.14 million square kilometers of sedimentary basins, 1.3 million sq km are in deep waters. India had its first foray into deepwater exploration in the Bay of Bengal earlier this year in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, courtesy of India's state run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). ONGC said it was planning to spend over $10 billion developing multiple deepwater projects in its KG-DWN-98/2 block in that basin.\\n\\nMeanwhile, state-owned upstream company Oil India Ltd is looking to start exploration activities in Nagaland\\n\\n\\\"We have a total of 30 blocks under the OALP. We have already drilled all wells under the awarded OALP blocks, except in Nagaland. We are pursuing the ministry and they have set up a high power committee involving OIL, ONGC, government officials, to discuss the issue with the Government of Nagaland and resume exploration,\\\" the official said.\\n\\nUnlike Pakistan, India is likely to have little trouble attracting the oil and gas majors. Indeed, British energy giant BP Plc (NYSE:BP) is holding a board meeting in India this week, as it hunts for more opportunities in the country. BP has forged a joint venture with Indian multinational conglomerate Reliance Industries to operate 1,900 fuel retail stations across India and produces oil and gas from a deepwater block in the Krishna-Godavari basin. The JV has teamed up with ONGC to bid for exploration rights for an offshore block in India.\\n\\nNational oil companies (NOCs) account for 58% of global reserves and 56% of production. However, International Oil Companies (IOCs) also play a major role in the energy sector by contributing to the general economic and social development of the host country. Indeed, IOCs are obliged through Production Sharing Agreement to pay royalty fees to the host country.\\n\\nAnalysts have predicted that India is set to become the key driver of global oil demand growth, overtaking China.\\n\\n\\\"China's role as a global oil demand growth engine is fading fast,\\\" Emma Richards, senior analyst at London-based Fitch Solutions Ltd, told The Times of India. According to the analyst, over the next decade, China's share of emerging market oil demand growth will decline from nearly 50% to just 15% while India's share will double to 24%.\\n\\nA rapidly growing population, which has likely surpassed China's, is expected to be the main driver of consumption trends in India. Meanwhile, the country's transition from traditional gasoline and diesel-fueled transport is expected to lag other regions, in sharp contrast to China's skyrocketing adoption of electric vehicles and clean energy in general.\\n\\n\\\"India was always going to exceed China in a matter of time in terms of being the global demand growth driver, mainly due to demographic factors like population growth,\\\" Parsley Ong, the head of Asia energy and chemicals research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Hong Kong, has told Bloomberg.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"oilprice.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"OilPrice.com\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Business\",\"label\":\"news/Business\",\"wgt\":100}],\"image\":\"https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2024-09-26_x8osqf0iak.jpg\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.3411764705882352,\"wgt\":465091285,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878715\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:01:26\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:26Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:04Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.529411792755127,\"url\":\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/weir-internationals-not-rolling-over-after-nightmare-presidents-cup-start-4641611\",\"title\":\"Weir: Internationals not rolling over after nightmare Presidents Cup start\",\"body\":\"Canadian Mike Weir's International Team endured a nightmare start to the Presidents Cup on Thursday but the former Masters champion insisted his squad still believe they have time to turn things around and end the Americans' dominant run.\\n\\nThe U.S., who entered the week as a prohibitive favorite to secure a 10th consecutive Presidents Cup, swept the opening day fourballs session at Royal Montreal Golf Club 5-0, leaving many to wonder what, if anything, Weir's team needs to change.\\n\\n\\\"Well, it's certainly not the team unity and the team spirit.

14,800 euro (£12,300) flight from London to Nice for transferring art and jewellery to a fundraising event in Cannes in 2018.\\n\\nIt also looked into the decision to spend 9,400 euros (£7,800) of charity funds on a three-night stay at a five-star hotel for Campbell.\\n\\nIn these cases, the trustees \\\"failed to show how these were cost-effective and an appropriate use of the charity's resources\\\", the Charity Commission said.\\n\\nFurthermore, it examined expenses incurred by Campbell totalling nearly 7,940 euros (£6,600), alongside the hotel stay, paid for by the charity.\\n\\nThese costs included spa treatments, room service, and the purchase of cigarettes and hotel products.\\n\\nThe regulator said trustees explained that hotel costs were typically covered by a donor to the charity, therefore not costing the charity, but failed to provide any evidence to support this.\\n\\nRepresentatives for Campbell have been contacted for comment.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"thewestonmercury.co.uk\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Weston

DT Jordan Elliott Carted Off Practice Field with Foot Injury\",\"body\":\"Defensive tackle Jordan Elliott reportedly injured his foot during practice and was carted off the field, which suggests the injury is serious. The 49ers officially listed Elliott as limited in Thursday's practice because technically he participated until he went down. Kyle Shanahan will provide more information when he speaks to the media on Friday.\\n\\nThe 49ers signed Elliott this offseason to be a backup defensive tackle. Through three games, he has played 57 defensive snaps and recorded two tackles. But this past Sunday, starting defensive tackle Javon Hargrave partially tore his tricep and the 49ers placed him on season-ending Injured Reserve.\\n\\nWhich means Elliott was supposed to be the next man up. He was supposed to replace Hargrave in the starting lineup. And while Elliott can't replace the pressure Hargrave creates on the quarterback, Elliott has the ability to improve the run defense when healthy.\\n\\nNow the 49ers will have to turn to Kevin Givens to start at defensive tackle next to Maliek Collins. Givens has been a quality backup defensive tackle for the 49ers since 2019. He even started 11 games in 2022 when they had the no. 1 defense in the league. So he's not a liability.\\n\\nBut the 49ers now are incredibly thin at defensive tackle. They have Collins, Givens and that's about it. Look for them to call up at least one defensive tackle for the practice squad. Also, Kalia Davis will be eligible to come off Injured Reserve next week.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"si.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Sports Illustrated\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":92}],\"image\":\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4266,h_2399,x_0,y_142/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_49ers/01j8rak2pg5svtb4wye6.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9931042\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1},\"sentiment\":-0.003921568627450966,\"wgt\":465091291,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878749\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:01:31\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:31Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:09Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.6039215922355652,\"url\":\"https://lana.gov.ly/post.php?lang=en&id=316036\",\"title\":\"Norland: America supports the African Union\",\"body\":\"New York, September 27, 2024 (LANA) - US Special Envoy to Libya Richard Norland said he discussed with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Congo Jean-Claude Gakosso joint efforts to revive the political process in Libya.\\n\\nAmbassador Norland added in a tweet he posted yesterday, Thursday, on the website of the US Embassy to Libya on \\\"X\\\" that Minister Gakosso presented to me during the meeting that brought us together during the high-level discussions of the United Nations General Assembly in New York the support of the African Union to hold a reconciliation conference that brings together former opponents to pave the way for the reunification of Libya.\\n\\nNorland said ((The United States supports the African Union and is working with Libyan partners to organize this important event)).\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"lana.gov.ly\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"lana.gov.ly\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Government\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Government\",\"wgt\":100}],\"image\":\"https://lana.gov.ly/images/src/316036.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9943873\",\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.6784313725490196,\"wgt\":465091291,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878772\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:01:32\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:32Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:13Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2024-09/63375187-eqs-adhoc-dexus-finance-pty-limited-2024-notice-of-annual-general-meeting-023.htm\",\"title\":\"EQS-Adhoc: Dexus Finance Pty Limited: 2024 Notice of Annual General Meeting\",\"body\":\"EQS-Ad-hoc: Dexus Finance Pty Limited / Key word(s): AGM/EGM\\n\\nDexus Finance Pty Limited: 2024 Notice of Annual General Meeting\\n\\n27-Sep-2024 / 01:56 CET/CEST\\n\\nDisclosure of an inside information acc. to Article 17 MAR of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, transmitted by EQS News - a service of EQS Group AG.\\n\\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\\n\\nDexus (ASX: DXS)\\n\\nASX release\\n\\n27 September 2024\\n\\n2024 Notice of Annual General Meeting\\n\\nDexus today confirmed details relating to its 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM).\\n\\nThe 2024 AGM will be a hybrid meeting, with Security holders invited to join the meeting in person or attend virtually on Wednesday 30 October 2024, commencing at 2.00pm (AEDST).\\n\\nRegistration will commence at 1.30pm (AEDST) at Dexus Place, Level 15, 1 Farrer Place, Sydney NSW 2000 or via the AGM link available at www.dexus.com/AGM2024.\\n\\nThe Notice of Annual General Meeting, letter to Security holders, a sample Voting and Question Form and the Virtual Online Meeting Guide are attached and will be provided to Dexus Security holders today.

law license in New York for pursuing false claims that then-President Donald Trump made about his 2020 presidential election loss.\\n\\nThe brief ruling from D.C.'s appeals court said Giuliani did not respond to an order to explain why he should not be disbarred in Washington after he was in New York last summer.\\n\\nTed Goodman, a spokesperson for Giuliani, called the decision \\\"an absolute travesty and a total miscarriage of justice.\\\" Giuliani has argued that he believed the claims he was making on behalf of the Trump campaign were true.\\n\\n\\\"Members of the legal community who want to protect the integrity of our justice system should immediately speak out against this partisan, politically motivated decision,\\\" Goodman said in a text message.\\n\\nIt's the latest blow to the man once lauded as \\\"America's mayor.\\\" His advocacy of Trump's false election claims has also led to criminal charges. He's also facing financial ruin after a jury last year awarded $148 million in damages to two former Georgia election workers who sued him for defamation over lies he spread about them in 2020.\\n\\nGiuliani was one of the most vocal defenders of Trump in 2020, pushing unsubstantiated claims of large-scale voter fraud in the election the Republican lost to President Joe Biden.\\n\\nGiuliani previously had his law license suspended in Washington. A review panel last year recommended that he be disbarred over claims in a Pennsylvania lawsuit seeking to overturn Trump's loss there.\\n\\nGiuliani \\\"claimed massive election fraud but had no evidence,\\\" the panel wrote.\\n\\nThe former Georgia election workers -- Wandrea \\\"Shaye\\\" Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, asked a court last month to force Giuliani to turn over his New York apartment, any remaining cash and some of his prized New York Yankees memorabilia, including three World Series rings and a signed shirt of player Joe DiMaggio.\\n\\nFreeman and Moss also staked a claim to the estimated $2 million Giuliani previously said Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign owes him. They also sought to take control of another Giuliani property -- his Palm Beach, Florida condominium -- through another legal mechanism known as receivership.\\n\\nGiuliani filed for bankruptcy shortly after the defamation verdict in December. But a judge in July threw out his case, citing failures to comply with court orders, failure to disclose sources of income and his apparent unwillingness to hire an accountant to go over his books.\\n\\nGiuliani has pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges in the Arizona case alleging he spread false claims of election fraud there after the 2020 election.

Crew members - including aviation survival technician Philip Morie and helicopter pilot Lt. Katherine McDonnell - were notified that \\\"an 8-year-old male passenger onboard was diagnosed with appendicitis and needed to be medevaced.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We didn't have it in sight, which from 10 miles out, flying at like 300 or 400 feet ...

As we got closer and closer, we were out about 5 miles and we're like, 'Well, we still can't see it.'\\\"\\n\\nAlthough foggy conditions made it difficult to spot the ship, at around 8 a.m. local time, an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter arrived to evacuate the passenger named Daniel Jiang, and his family. Footage shows Morie rappelling down to hoist the boy into a large metal rescue basket before the helicopter lifted him into its compartment.\\n\\n\\\"On the way up, you know, I'm just still talking to the kid and, you know, giving him high fives and trying to keep him calm,\\\" Morie noted. Throughout the medevac situation, Daniel told the outlet he kept his eyes shut the entire time.\\n\\nTwo more of Daniel's family members - his mother Nicole and brother - were taken up in the basket as well.\\n\\nNicole explained what happened at the time, saying: \\\"The doctor in the cruise said the situation is very [much an] emergency ... Daniel got [a] very high fever and the situation [grew] worse and worse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know how to describe [it],\\\" she recalled of the experience, noting the rescue was \\\"unbelievable.\\\"\\n\\nThe Coast Guard team was able to rush Daniel and his family in time to a hospital so that he could be immediately admitted into surgery and get an appendectomy. His surgery was thankfully a success and has since remained in the hospital, recovering from the procedure. His doctors have confirmed that he will be alright.\\n\\nThe rescue mission was McDonnell's first on the job, with the pilot reflecting that it was \\\"a pretty incredible feeling\\\" knowing that she played a part in saving the youngster's life. Meanwhile, Morie, for whom this wasn't his first rodeo, noted that it was \\\"a big win for everybody involved.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"independent.co.uk\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"The Independent\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Arts_and_Entertainment\",\"label\":\"news/Arts and Entertainment\",\"wgt\":47}],\"image\":\"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/27/00/newFile.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1},\"sentiment\":0.08235294117647052,\"wgt\":465091296,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878783\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:01:37\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:37Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:14Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://mb.com.ph/2024/9/26/netanyahu-vows-to-use-full-force-against-hezbollah-and-dims-hopes-for-a-cease-fire\",\"title\":\"Netanyahu vows to use 'full force' against Hezbollah and dims hopes for a cease-fire\",\"body\":\"NEW YORK (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday vowed to carry out \\\"full force\\\" strikes against Hezbollah until it ceases firing rockets across the border, dimming hopes for a cease-fire proposal put forth by U.S. and European officials.\\n\\nIsrael carried out a new strike in the Lebanese capital, which killed a senior Hezbollah commander, and the militant group launched dozens of rockets into Israel. Tens of thousands of Israeli and Lebanese people living near their countries' border have been displaced by the fighting.\\n\\nNetanyahu spoke as he landed in New York to attend the annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, where U.S. and European officials were putting heavy pressure on both sides of the conflict to accept a proposed 21-day halt in the fighting to give time for diplomacy and avert all-out war.\\n\\nNearly 700 people have been killed in Lebanon this week as Israel dramatically escalated strikes, saying it is targeting Hezbollah's military capacities. Israeli leaders say they are determined to stop the group's cross-border attacks, which began after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that ignited the war in Gaza.\\n\\nIsrael's \\\"policy is clear,\\\" Netanyahu said. \\\"We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force. And we will not stop until we reach all our goals, chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes.\\\"\\n\\nJust before his comments, the Israeli military said it killed a Hezbollah drone commander, Mohammed Hussein Surour, in an airstrike in the suburbs of Beirut. Hezbollah later confirmed Surour's death.\\n\\nThe Health Ministry said two people were killed and 15 wounded in the strike. Associated Press photos of the scene showed a gutted apartment in a residential building in Dahiyeh, the mainly Shiite suburb where Hezbollah has a strong presence.\\n\\nUntil recently, Israel had rarely targeted sites in Beirut during the low-level conflict with Hezbollah that has been ongoing since October. However, in the past week, Israel has struck Beirut's southern suburbs several times.\\n\\nOver the past week, Israel has carried out several strikes in Beirut targeting senior Hezbollah commanders. One strike in eastern Lebanon on Thursday killed 20 people, most of them Syrian migrants, according to Lebanese health officials.\\n\\nIsrael hit 75 sites early Thursday across southern and eastern Lebanon and launched a new wave of strikes in the evening, the military said. Throughout the day, Hezbollah fired some 175 projectiles into Israel, the Israeli military said. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, sparking some wildfires, though one rocket hit a street in a town near the northern city of Safed.\\n\\nIsrael has talked of a possible ground invasion into Lebanon to drive Hezbollah -- an Iranian-backed Shiite group that is the strongest armed force in Lebanon -- away from the border. It has moved thousands of troops to the north in preparation. Some 100,000 Lebanese have fled their homes in the past week, streaming into Beirut and points further north.\\n\\nIsraeli military vehicles transported tanks and armored vehicles toward the country's northern border with Lebanon a day after commanders issued a call-up of reservists. Several tanks arrived in Kiryat Shmona, a hard-hit town just several miles from the border.\\n\\nOn another front, Israel's military on Friday said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen that set off air raid sirens across the country's center. Sirens rang out across Israel's populous central area, including the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv. Another missile from Yemen landed in central Israel about two weeks ago.\\n\\nThe escalation has raised fears of a repeat - or worse - of the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah that wreaked destruction across southern Lebanon and other parts of the country and saw heavy Hezbollah rocket fire on Israeli cities.\\n\\n\\\"Another full-scale war could be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon,\\\" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said after talks with his British and Australian counterparts in London.\\n\\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was at the U.N. meeting with Israeli officials over the truce proposal.

Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed it, but his government has no sway over the group.\\n\\nNetanyahu's office downplayed the initiative, saying in a statement that it was only a proposal.\\n\\nOne of Netanyahu's far-right governing partners threatened on Thursday to suspend cooperation with his government if it signs onto a temporary cease-fire with Hezbollah - and to quit completely if a permanent deal is reached. It was the latest sign of displeasure from Netanyahu's allies toward international cease-fire efforts.\\n\\n\\\"If a temporary cease-fire becomes permanent, we will resign from the government,\\\" said National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, head of the Jewish Power party.\\n\\nIf Ben-Gvir leaves the coalition, Netanyahu would lose his parliamentary majority and could see his government come toppling down, though opposition leaders have said they would offer support for a cease-fire deal.\\n\\nHezbollah has insisted it would halt its strikes only if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, where Israel has battled Hamas for nearly a year. That appears out of reach despite months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.\\n\\nOne day after Hamas' Oct 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel, bringing Israeli counterfire and a cycle of reprisals that has gone on near daily since.

The fighting also forced tens of thousands to flee homes on both sides of the border.\\n\\nIsrael says its escalated strikes across Lebanon the past week are targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. Since Monday, strikes have killed more than 690 people in Lebanon, around a quarter of them women and children, according to local health authorities.\\n\\nThe campaign opened with what is widely believed to be an Israeli attack on Sept. 18 and 19 detonating thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, killing at least 39 people and maiming thousands more, including civilians.\\n\\nHezbollah in turn has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel. Several people in Israel have been wounded. On Wednesday, the group fired on Tel Aviv for the first time with a longer-range missile that was intercepted.\\n\\nEarly Thursday, an Israeli airstrike hit a building housing Syrian workers and their families near the ancient city of Baalbek in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley.

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images / Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\\n\\nIt follows that a team doubling down on veterans would also undervalue the draft and struggle in talent evaluation. All of that fits together. If talent evaluation falls short, the team has to turn to veterans in trade and free agency, as the draft takes on a lesser role.\\n\\nChristian McCaffrey and Trent Williams acquired through trade. The impact drafted players on offense currently led by two seventh rounders (Brock Purdy and Jauan Jennings) and an undrafted free agent (Jordan Mason).\\n\\nThe primary example of poor talent evaluation and undervaluing the draft, the trade for Trey Lance. Three first-round picks for the wrong guy. Also the trade for McCaffrey, it proved worthwhile but the cost in draft capital was high, showing a team that doesn't place their highest priority on the draft, giving up picks in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds.\\n\\nThe 49ers have been saved by comp picks in the draft, if not for that, draft picks would have been scarce. The comp picks essentially saved the Niners from themselves and their preference to move picks for vets.\\n\\nTHE DRAFT\\n\\nThe 49ers hit rate in the draft has been poor in the early rounds (through the 4th) and outstanding late (5th through 7th). That speaks to misses by Kyle Shanahan early and a weakness in his talent evaluation.\\n\\nSince Shanahan and John Lynch took over in 2017, in the first four rounds the Niners have drafted two impact starters on offense and two on defense: Deebo Samuel, Brandon Aiyuk, Fred Warner, and Nick Bosa.\\n\\nThe Samuel pick stemmed from Shanahan coaching at the Senior Bowl and seeing Deebo live. Credit to Shanahan that he identified the talent, but is the pick made if Shanahan wasn't at Mobile? Fortunate.\\n\\nThe Aiyuk pick was on a recommendation from then-Arizona State coach Herm Edwards to his buddy Lynch. The Bosa pick was a gimme at #2 overall. So the lone impact player in the first four rounds that was scouted and picked is Warner.\\n\\nBy the numbers\\n\\nOn offense in the first four rounds, two impact starters in Samuel and Aiyuk out of 15 picks, nine busts. An impact hit rate of 13% and a bust rate of 75%. The nine busts all Shanahan picks at quarterback, running back, wide receiver, and tight end. That's the danger of having an offensive coordinator picking for his offense out of self-interest as the defacto GM.\\n\\nOn defense in the first four rounds, two impact starters in Warner and Bosa out of eleven picks with six busts. An impact hit rate of 18% and a bust rate of 54%.\\n\\nWhy do the 49ers lack impact young talent, especially on defense? Poor talent evaluation with too many busts, and a bias toward offense picks, all to be expected under Shanahan. As a reminder, on roles and responsibilities, this quote from Lynch, \\\"Kyle has the 53, I have the 90.\\\"\\n\\nAll the picks through four rounds and only one of them an impact starter as a product of scouting and selection with no special circumstances. When I say that Shanahan is the biggest barrier to a 49ers championship, poor talent evaluation like this is a key part of why.\\n\\nThe evaluation weakness is further compounded by Shanahan's clear bias for veterans, and players fully versed in his system. Purdy, Mason, and Jennings were all buried or with limited roles until injury forced them on the field.\\n\\nShanahan's bias played out in the Rams game late with Ronnie Bell inexplicably on the field and targeted with the game on the line, despite a drop earlier in the game, and a camp with more of the same.\\n\\nPoor talent evaluation can also lead to overvaluing players from Bell to a reliance on Jake Brendel at center and Colton McKivitz at right tackle. Shanahan's cap philosophy of using the offensive line as a cap-savings center comes at a cost on the field. Would Brendel or McKivitz start on any other team? Probably not.\\n\\nThe offensive line is also hurt by another Shanahan bias, this time in the draft, not to draft offensive linemen early. That bias then plays into another GM mistake, not using what the draft gives you. The best OL class in a decade, and only one pick is used on the line. A big credit to Shanahan that the pick is Dominic Puni, who looks like a great find, but imagine if more linemen from this class were taken given what Puni has shown as a 3rd rounder.\\n\\nThe evaluation weakness also plays out in free agency. Javon Hargrave, an unfortunate injury, but he hasn't played up to his contract. Leonard Floyd is not a factor yet, De'Vondre Campbell and Isaac Yiadom have both been liabilities.\\n\\nThe Niners find themselves in this 1-2 hole as an accumulation of bad decisions, most of them by Shanahan as head coach and defacto GM.\\n\\nThe Niners have time to recover and regroup, but these are systemic problems. As has been true throughout his tenure Shanahan is both gift and curse. A brilliant play designer and scripter, a very good head coach with a few blind spots that genuinely hurt the team - and an average to poor GM.\\n\\nNext time, a look at what the Niners need to do to recover, both this season and long-term.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"si.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Sports Illustrated\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":100}],\"image\":\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2967,h_1668,x_0,y_71/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_49ers/01j8raxb1m1cvx9d1azb.jpg\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.223529411764706,\"wgt\":465091298,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"p-8338878813\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:01:39\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:39Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:19Z\",\"dataType\":\"pr\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/27/2954220/673/en/ROSEN-TRUSTED-INVESTOR-COUNSEL-Encourages-Bumble-Inc-Investors-to-Secure-Counsel-Before-Important-Deadline-in-Securities-Class-Action-BMBL.html\",\"title\":\"ROSEN, TRUSTED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Bumble Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - BMBL\",\"body\":\"NEW YORK, Sept. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\\n\\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of all purchasers of securities of Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ: BMBL) between November 7, 2023 and August 7, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \\\"Class Period\\\"). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 25, 2024\\n\\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Bumble securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\\n\\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Bumble class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3076 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 25, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\\n\\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Bumble's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth on the back of its tiered-subscription options and subsequent app relaunch, while also downplaying the potential disruption to Bumble's brand and reputation caused by the imminent change in leadership. In truth, Bumble's Premium Plus subscription plan did not have a clear market fit and would very quickly need to be revamped. Bumble's tiered-subscription options were ill equipped to provide the claimed revenue per user benefit to Bumble's faltering market share, particularly regarding user growth and monetization. Defendants misled investors by providing the public with materially flawed statements of confidence and growth projections which did not account for these variables. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\\n\\nTo join the Bumble class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3076or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\\n\\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\\n\\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\\n\\nAttorney Advertising.

Gottwald, who denied any wrongdoing, countersued Kesha for defamation and a long-running lawsuit was finally settled out of court last year.\\n\\nPerry reasserted her pop credentials with a powerful performance at this month's Video Music Awards in New York, revisiting classic hits such as Firework -- but a return to the fray that should have soared like a mini-rocket has so far proved a damp squib.\\n\\nDespite all that, 143 manages to avoid being an unmitigated disaster. Named after Perry's 'angel number' (the numerical shorthand for I Love You), it has its moments. There are some passable, if dated, dance numbers plus two touching songs inspired by her four-year-old daughter Daisy and the latter's dad, Hollywood star Orlando Bloom.\\n\\nThe first of these, Lifetimes, is an ebullient, house-style banger. The second, Wonder, provides the album with its show-stopping, theatrical finale, one in which Daisy has a fleeting cameo. 'Stay pure, beautiful girl,' sings Perry.\\n\\nElsewhere, however, the 39-year-old singer chases trends without any real conviction or sense of fun. On the slinky Gimme Gimme and Crush, her voice is annoyingly coated in auto-tune, while the revenge song I'm His, He's Mine contains an incongruous sample from Crystal Waters's Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless), a 1991 single about a destitute busker.\\n\\nThe Perry of old emerges only in flashes. All The Love, which starts as an electronic ballad before the pace quickens, allows her to finally open up her voice.\\n\\nBut much of 143 feels generic and laboured, its failings thrown into sharper relief by the rise of a new wave of wittily inventive, less calculating pop goddesses. Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and others have upped the ante. In contrast, this is devoid of the simple musical pleasures that once made Katy so captivating.\\n\\nPIXIE LOTT: Encino (BMG)\\n\\nVerdict: Unexpected reinvention\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nPixie Lott was one of several female singers who emerged in the slipstream of Amy Winehouse in the late 2000s. Her first two singles, Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh) and Boys And Girls, both topped the UK charts in 2009 by channelling\\n\\na retro-soul sound clearly inspired by Amy. She reached No. 1 again, two years later, with All About Tonight, cementing her status as one of the era's leading party girls.\\n\\nNow making a musical comeback after a decade that has seen her pivot to the stage and TV, the Essex-raised singer has taken an unexpected turn, edging away from dance to something more classic and band-orientated. Maybe we shouldn't be quite so surprised, though: when I spoke to her in 2009, Lott confessed she was a pop princess who often felt 'more hippy, vintage and indie' -- and she gleefully explores all those traits on Encino.\\n\\nPixie Lott was one of several female singers who emerged in the slipstream of Amy Winehouse in the late 2000s\\n\\nCo-writing every track here, the maturing Pixie Lott also exorcises a few of her demons in the album\\n\\nMade in Los Angeles with producers Dave Gibson and Jeeve, the 33-year-old's first album since 2014 makes the most of her naturally versatile, expressive voice. There's an Adele-like richness to Further From Love, while the acoustic-based Show You Love, all strummed guitars and mandolin, taps into this year's country-pop trend. Co-writing every track here, the maturing Lott also exorcises a few of her demons, addressing online bullying on Somebody's Daughter and her battles with insomnia on Midnight Trash. The bruised piano ballad Say So, sung in a fragile falsetto, was inspired by what she says was an emotionally draining, three-month stint playing Holly Golightly in the 2016 West End adaptation of Breakfast At Tiffany's.\\n\\nBut the overall mood is buoyant. The nostalgic Blockbuster Video harks back to a time when watching a film at home meant a rented VHS tape rather than a digital stream. Another country-ish tune, Happy, has taken on fresh meaning for Lott since she gave birth to a son, Albert, last year. The album closes with Comes Back Around, an acoustic song about learning from mistakes that takes inspiration from T. S. Eliot's war-time poem Little Gidding. If that doesn't banish Pixie's frothy image, surely nothing will.\\n\\nBEST OF THE NEW RELEASESFAIRGROUND ATTRACTION\\n\\nBeautiful Happening (Raresong)\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nMark Nevin's band definitely live up to the billing on a comeback album that comes 34 years later\\n\\nSongwriter Mark Nevin once said that Fairground Attraction were 'jazz musicians playing pop on folk instruments', and his band definitely live up to the billing on a comeback album that arrives 34 long years after we last heard from them on 1990's Ay Fond Kiss.\\n\\nGatecrashing Heaven, beautifully sung by Eddi Reader, is a doo-wop ballad, and What's Wrong With The World? (answer: 'maybe it's me') harks back to their debut hit Perfect. Still able to conjure up a winning hook, the band will begin a UK reunion tour tomorrow night at the Wulfrun Hall at the University of Wolverhampton.\\n\\nTHE VOIDZ\\n\\nLike All Before You (Cult)\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nThis latest album skips haphazardly between electronic pop, guitar tracks and ambient piano pieces\\n\\nAs the lead singer and main creative force with The Strokes, Julian Casablancas was a pivotal figure in the garage-rock boom of the 2000s. With his other group, The Voidz, he is more adventurous, rather like Blur's Damon Albarn is in Gorillaz.\\n\\nCasablancas' eclectic instincts, however, can sometimes get the better of him, and that's certainly true here. This latest album skips haphazardly between electronic pop, guitar tracks and ambient piano pieces. Flexorcist, with its echoes of early New York hip-hop and 1908s electro, is a highlight -- although fans of The Strokes are warned to approach with caution.\\n\\nMJ LENDERMAN\\n\\nManning Fireworks (Anti-)\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nMark Jacob Lenderman plays most of the instruments himself on the album but his guitar heroics take centre staf\\n\\nThe new hope of Americana, North Carolina singer-songwriter Mark Jacob Lenderman puts a country-ish slant on 1990s indie-rock.\\n\\nThe former ice-cream salesman plays most of the instruments himself, but it's his guitar heroics that take centre stage, ragged on the title track, heavier on Bark At The Moon, an homage to Ozzy Osbourne. His witty lyrics catch the ear, too, with pop culture references abounding. There's a nod to The Band on You Don't Know The Shape I'm In, and On My Knees has a reference to 'Travolta's bald head'.\\n\\nShe's Leaving You tells of a middle-aged philanderer who believes Eric Clapton 'was the second coming'.\\n\\nEmanuel Feuermann Edition\\n\\n(Sony 19439977442, seven CDs)\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nThis box includes everything Feuermann recorded for RCA Victor, and if you can be patient with sound quality from 1939-41\\n\\nKilled by medical bungling in 1942, aged 39, Emanuel Feuermann is still regarded by cellists with awe and envy.\\n\\nThis box includes everything Feuermann recorded for RCA Victor, and if you can be patient with sound quality from 1939-41, you will find his tone quite irresistible.

Cruz up by four, the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation has Cruz up by three, and Morning Consult has Allred up by one.\\n\\nWhile political experts suggest you should not take one poll as gospel, one can see the trend of the race by looking at several surveys.\\n\\n\\\"The sleeping giant is awake and the sleeping giant is determinative of who will win these races,\\\" said Jason Villalba, a former Republican state representative and now the chair of the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation.\\n\\nVillalba's latest poll shows Trump up six but Cruz only up three. The difference, according to Villalba, is Trump's overperformance among Texas Hispanic voters.\\n\\n\\\"The unifying theme is generally they're immigrants into the country. They're family-centric. They're conservative in the kitchen table issues but they're not necessarily conservative in what we'd consider political issues. So guns and abortion aren't going to be issues that resonate, but education and healthcare are,\\\" said Villalba.\\n\\nIf Harris can cut away Trump's Hispanic support, she can bring the race closer, he said. Congressman Allred can pull off an upset, per Villalba.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"nbcdfw.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Tukong_Moosul\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Tukong Moosul\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Politics\",\"label\":\"news/Politics\",\"wgt\":97}],\"image\":\"https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/09/generic-voting-sign.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1},\"sentiment\":0.1294117647058823,\"wgt\":465091310,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338878792\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:01:50\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:50Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:15Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.4823529422283173,\"url\":\"https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/rare-mormon-gold-coin-with-millions-to-go-on-display\",\"title\":\"Rare Mormon gold coin with millions to go on display\",\"body\":\"SALT LAKE CITY -- A rare Mormon gold from nearly two centuries old is set to go on display for all of Utah to see.\\n\\nThe coin from 1849 is currently at the All About Coins shop in the Sugar House neighborhood of Salt Lake City, but it can been seen at this weekend's Utah Coin Show in Sandy.\\n\\nMinted from the gold dust first discovered in California during the Gold Rush, at one point it was brought to Salt Lake City and made into coins, according to All About Coins owner Bob Campbell.\\n\\n\\\"This particular one is the finest known of the 20 or so that are still around,\\\" Campbell said. \\\"All the others have been melted down over the years and are lost.\\\"\\n\\nCampbell estimates the coin is worth more than a million dollars.\\n\\nSurprisingly enough, the family that found the coin over a decade ago had no clue they had discovered a gem.\\n\\n\\\"It was actually found by a family in a safety deposit box after their grandparents had passed away,\\\" Campbell said. \\\"The family had no idea what it was worth.\\\"\\n\\nThe coin represents a piece of Utah's rich history.\\n\\n\\\"It speaks to the early days of the pioneers,\\\" Campbell added. \\\"To see history in your hands -- that's what makes it so interesting.\\\"\\n\\nFor Frank Balena, a new coin specialist at the shop, being surrounded by the rare coins never gets old.\\n\\n\\\"Being able to hold a coin like that is holding history in your hand and in doing so, you're able to see the story that coin endured throughout history,\\\" Balena said. \\\"Every nick, every scratch, and every mark that's on it is a story.\\\"\\n\\nThe coin will be on display from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Salt Lake Community College Conference Center at Miller Campus.

Set against a backdrop of sun-faded apricots, blushes and soft whites, the Paris collection captured Kamali's vision of a summer that she surmised as: \\\"when you pause, escape, explore and recharge.\\\" It celebrated Chloé's free-spirited DNA, infused with a lightness that felt both nostalgic and forward-looking.\\n\\nHere are some highlights of Thursday's shows at Paris Fashion Week, including when Naomi Campbell was awarded a prestigious honor in France:\\n\\nKamali's joyful freedom\\n\\n\\\"There's a liberating expression of total freedom,\\\" Kamali said, of her spring display.\\n\\nThis freedom flowed through silk charmeuse gowns, lingerie-inspired crop tops and peek-a-boo designs.\\n\\nEchoes of Karl Lagerfeld's 70s Chloé lingered in exaggerated shoulders and standout pieces, like a loose-fitting, vivid blue coat. \\\"Chloé is not a passing moment; it's an eternal state of mind,\\\" Kamali noted, grounding her collection in the house's long-standing ethos of optimism and instinct.\\n\\nLayering played a central role, but Kamali kept it light and intuitive, reflecting what she called a \\\"very personal way of dressing.\\\" Sheer fabrics and sun-worn lace mixed effortlessly with ribbed jerseys, creating looks that felt weightless and spontaneous, a signature of Kamali's debut collection. \\\"What matters to me is the feeling and intuition,\\\" she said.\\n\\nA standout moment came in the form of a dramatic trapeze-shaped silk gown, its dynamic silhouette swirling with movement. It epitomized Kamali's ability to honor Chloé's romantic roots while infusing a modern sensibility. \\\"The mood is light, weightless, sensual and joyful,\\\" she explained. That joyful freedom was a defining thread from start to finish.\\n\\nWith her second outing, Kamali proved she is the right designer to lead Chloé. She crafted a spring collection that balanced nostalgia and sensuality while pushing the house toward a bright, optimistic future.\\n\\nMugler's Cadwallader takes a bite at fashion\\n\\nCasey Cadwallader delivered a striking debut for Mugler, equal parts theatrical and innovative. The hair, sculpted into harsh fringes like a viper's fang, set the tone for a collection defined by sharp architectural lines. Curving lapels adorned tight jackets, while tendrils of latticed silk flowed into skirts that bled vibrant yellows, creating a visual spectacle.\\n\\nThe collection boldly embraced femininity, featuring a bust that echoed the form of seashells and a densely packed bustier resembling a diving whale. This daring aesthetic aligns with Cadwallader's aim to infuse the brand with a fresh energy, moving away from the extravagance that some original Mugler fans long for. However, the theatrical elements, while captivating, may prompt questions about whether they overshadow the essence of traditional fashion presentation.\\n\\nOversized tubular arms complemented a webbed skirt-coat, while a transparent loose trench evoked the look of a sea medusa, reinforcing Cadwallader's commitment to pushing boundaries. This collection showcases a provocative take on body-conscious design and inclusivity, aiming to resonate with a diverse audience.\\n\\nYet, Cadwallader's choice to prioritize multimedia and performance raises concerns. Critics may feel this direction dilutes the brand's identity, diverting from the high-fashion roots that established Mugler's reputation. The sentiment that the house is now focused more on entertainment than on pure fashion is a conversation that continues to unfold.\\n\\nAs the audience reacted with applause, it was clear that while not everyone may embrace this new vision, those who do are eager for more.\\n\\nNaomi Campbell honored in France amid charity controversy\\n\\nIconic British model Naomi Campbell was awarded a prestigious honor in France, being named a knight in the Order of Arts and Letters at the country's culture ministry for her significant contributions to French culture.\\n\\nHowever, this recognition comes as Campbell faces scrutiny back home, having been barred from serving as a charity trustee in England and Wales for five years. This decision follows a three-year investigation into the financial activities of her charity, \\\"Fashion for Relief,\\\" which was found to have been \\\"poorly governed\\\" and lacking in \\\"adequate financial management.\\\"\\n\\nThe Charity Commission, which oversees charities in England and Wales, reported multiple instances of misconduct, revealing that only 8.5% of the charity's expenditures went to charitable grants over a six-year period from 2016. Notably, the inquiry uncovered that charity funds were misused for Campbell's luxury hotel stays during events in Cannes, alongside personal expenses such as spa treatments and room service.\\n\\nIn response to a question from the AP, Campbell said, \\\"I've just found out today about the findings and I am extremely concerned. We are investigating on our side. I was not in control of my charity; I put the control in the hands of a legal employer. We are investigating to find out what and how, and everything I do and every penny I ever raised goes to charity.\\\"\\n\\nAlongside Campbell, fellow trustee Bianka Hellmich has been disqualified for nine years after receiving unauthorized payments for consultancy services, while trustee Veronica Chou has been barred for four years. The charity, founded in 2005 to unite the fashion industry in addressing global poverty, was dissolved earlier this year, having raised over $15 million for various causes worldwide.\\n\\nDespite the controversy, Campbell's honor in France highlights her lasting impact on the cultural landscape.\\n\\nRick Owens' enchants with gothic splendor\\n\\nAt Thursday's show at the Palais de Tokyo, Rick Owens unleashed a captivating spectacle that felt like a dramatic descent into a realm inhabited by gothic aliens. The atmosphere was thick with smoke and suspense as an army of biblical figures marched out in impressive diagonal formations, their asymmetrical knee-high leather boots featuring translucent heels, making each step a statement.\\n\\nOwens' trademark angular, alien-like geometric shoulders dominated the runway, capturing the essence of his singular vision -- one that merges dark romanticism with avant-garde aesthetics. The collection was a testament to his ability to blend his gothic instincts with a sense of reverent irreverence, reminiscent of the \\\"delicate time\\\" he referenced in previous collections, where beauty and horror coexist.\\n\\nAs the show unfolded, a billowing coven emerged, clad in oversized black priest-like hoods and flowing tulle cloaks that draped elegantly over their forms. Some models donned discreet headscarves, striking a balance between reverence and defiance, perfectly embodying Owens' commentary on societal norms. This juxtaposition echoes his commitment to inclusivity, presenting a vision of fashion that celebrates diversity while challenging conventional beauty standards.\\n\\nThe intricate craftsmanship used in the collection exemplified Owens' mastery. Each piece, from the cloaks to the striking silhouettes, invited viewers to appreciate humble fabrics. This aligns with his insistence that he presents \\\"the most excellent aesthetics\\\" possible, recognizing the nuanced interplay between the dark and the light in our world.\\n\\nWhile some may find Owens' aesthetic too avant-garde or even gloomy, this show reaffirmed his position as a provocative force in fashion. The theatricality and elaborate design remind us of his role as one of the last independent designers in Paris, navigating the complexities of the fashion landscape with fierce authenticity.\\n\\nAssociated Press journalist Marine Lesprit contributed to this report\\n\\nThomas Adamson, The Associated Press\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"timescolonist.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Times Colonist\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Knitting_and_Crochet\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Knitting and Crochet\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Arts_and_Entertainment\",\"label\":\"news/Arts and Entertainment\",\"wgt\":100}],\"image\":\"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2024/09/6f72780ab54aec3b8d056b1e0dff82e4a13d2aa22407d25ebaad530008fbdb22.jpg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.4823529411764707,\"wgt\":465091312,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338879114\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:01:54\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:54Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:35Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.on3.com/teams/kentucky-wildcats/news/here-comes-the-boom-recaps-week-kentucky-recruiting/\",\"title\":\"Here Comes the Boom Recaps the Week in Recruiting with Updates on Upcoming Kentucky OVs\",\"body\":\"Here Comes the Boom is back for a short recap of the week's recruiting news.

X said it received more than 224 million user reports during the first six months of this year.\\n\\nIt's the first time X has released a formal global transparency report since Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter in 2022. The company said last year it was reviewing how it approaches transparency reporting, but still released data about how many accounts and how much content were pulled down.\\n\\nSafety issues have long dogged the social media platform, which has faced criticism from advocacy groups, regulators and others that the company doesn't do enough to moderate harmful content. But those fears heightened after Musk took over Twitter and laid off more than 6,000 people from the company.\\n\\nThe release of X's transparency report also comes as advertisers plan to cut their spending on the platform next year and the company escalates its battle with regulators. This year, X's chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, told US lawmakers the company was restructuring its trust and safety teams and is building a trust and safety center in Austin, Texas.\\n\\nMusk, who said last year that advertisers who were boycotting his platform could \\\"go (expletive) yourself,\\\" has also moderated his tone. At this year's Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, he said that \\\"advertisers have a right to appear next to content that they find compatible with their brands.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Musk took over Twitter, several changes he made raised alarms among safety experts. X reinstated previously suspended accounts including those of white nationalists, stopped enforcing its policy against Covid-19 misinformation and abruptly disbanded its Trust and Safety Council, an advisory group that included human rights activists, child safety organizations and other experts.\\n\\nX has also grappled with scrutiny that it's become less transparent under Musk's leadership. The company, which was once publicly traded, became private after Musk purchased it for US$44bil (RM182bil).\\n\\nThe change meant that the social media platform no longer reported its quarterly user numbers and revenue publicly. Last year, X started charging for access to its data, making it tougher for researchers to conduct studies about the platform.\\n\\nConcerns about the lack of moderation on X has also posed a threat to its advertising business. The World Bank in September halted paid advertising on the platform after its ads showed up under a racist post. Roughly 25% of advertisers expect to decrease their spending on X next year and only 4% of advertisers think the platform's ads provide brand safety, according to a survey by the market research firm Kantar.\\n\\nSome of the top problems that users reported on X involved posts that allegedly violated the platform's rules on harassment, violent content and hateful conduct, the platform's transparency report shows.\\n\\nMusk, who has called himself a \\\"free speech absolutist,\\\" has said on X that his approach to enforcing the platform's rules is to restrict the reach of potentially offensive posts rather than taking down the posts. He also sued California last year over a state law that lawmakers say aims to make social networks more transparent because of free speech concerns.\\n\\nX's transparency report shows that toughly 2.8 million accounts were suspended for violating the platform's rules against child sexual exploitation, making up more than half of the 5.3 million accounts that were pulled down.\\n\\nBut the report also showed that X resorted to labeling user content in some cases rather than removing or suspending accounts.\\n\\nX applied 5.4 million labels to content reported for abuse, harassment and hateful conduct, relying heavily on automated technology. Roughly 2.2 million pieces of content were taken down for violating those rules.\\n\\nThe platform's rules state that the site doesn't allow media depicting hateful imagery such as the Nazi swastika in live videos, account bios, profiles or header images. Other instances, though, must be marked as sensitive media. This week, X also made changes to a feature that allows users to block people on the platform. People whom users have blocked will be able to see their posts but not engage with them.\\n\\nX also suspended nearly 464 million accounts for violating its rules against platform manipulation and spam. Musk vowed to \\\"defeat the spam bots\\\" on Twitter before he took over the platform. The company's report also included a metric called the \\\"post violation rate\\\" that showed users are unlikely to come across content that breaks the site's rules.\\n\\nMeanwhile, X continues to face legal challenges in several countries including Brazil, whose Supreme Court blocked the site because Musk failed to comply with court orders to suspend certain accounts for posting hate speech. The company bowed to legal demands this week in an attempt to get reinstated. It has also been reporting content moderation data to regulators in places such as Europe and India.\\n\\nThe report included the number of requests X gets from government and law enforcement agencies. The company received 18,737 government requests for user account information and it disclosed information in about 53% of these cases.\\n\\nTwitter started publicly reporting in 2012 the number of government requests it received for user information and content removal. The company's first transparency report, which also included data about copyright takedown notices, came after Google started releasing this data in 2010.\\n\\nAfter revelations surfaced in 2013 that the National Security Agency had access to user data that Apple, Google, Facebook and other tech giants collected, a growing number of online platforms started to disclose more information about requests they received from the government and law enforcement. - Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"thestar.com.my\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"The Star \"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Business\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Business\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Activism/Media\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Activism/Media\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Technology\",\"label\":\"news/Technology\",\"wgt\":98}],\"image\":\"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/09/26/2932686.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9936437\",\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":-0.3254901960784313,\"wgt\":465091320,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338879215\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":true,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:02:00\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:02:00Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:41Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://sports.yahoo.com/blackmon-shows-one-final-games-222606215.html\",\"title\":\"Blackmon drives in 3 runs in one of the last games of his career as Rockies beat Cardinals 10-8\",\"body\":\"DENVER (AP) -- Charlie Blackmon had three RBIs and three runs in one of the final games of his professional career, Michael Toglia had three hits and two RBIs, and the Colorado Rockies avoided a sweep with a come-from-behind 10-8 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday.\\n\\nA two-run, game-tying double from Ezequiel Tovar was the catalyst of a five-run eighth inning for the Rockies, who had lost five of their previous six games.

The 38-year-old Blackmon announced Monday he would be retiring at the end of the season. His three RBIs were his most in a game since May 27. His father threw out the game's ceremonial first pitch, a strike.\\n\\n\\\"I think I'd like to be able to enjoy this, these last three games,\\\" Blackmon said. \\\"I don't have any goals except for the fact I want to remember as much as I can and enjoy it.\\\"\\n\\nAngel Chivilli (2-3) picked up the win for the Rockies while Ryan Fernandez (1-6) took the loss for St. Louis after giving up four of Colorado's five eighth inning runs.

In 2023, Graterol was dominant, pitching to a stellar 1.20 ERA across 68 appearances. The Dodgers' bullpen is better when Graterol is available. He may even emerge as a potential closer at some point down the road.\\n\\nAt the moment, though, Graterol's primary focus is on returning from his shoulder injury.\\n\\nThe Dodgers have 94 wins so far in 2024. They have enjoyed another impressive regular season, but will the Dodgers be in trouble once the playoffs begin?\\n\\nThe offense is strong. Shohei Ohtani is currently in the process of completing a remarkable campaign. He will win the National League MVP after recording a 50-50 season.\\n\\nThe starting rotation has question marks, however. Injuries are the primary culprit for those question marks. LA has plenty of talented pitchers on the roster, but many of those hurlers happen to be injured.\\n\\nThe Dodgers bullpen's performance will be pivotal in October. Graterol's potential absence is far from ideal, but Los Angeles still has enough bullpen talent to take care of business. The Dodgers bullpen will be the X-factor once the playoffs get underway.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"clutchpoints.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"ClutchPoints\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"joey_mistretta@clutchpoints.com\",\"name\":\"Joey Mistretta\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":90}],\"image\":\"https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dodgers-news-LA-reliever-lands-on-IL-before-playoffs.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9942152\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1},\"sentiment\":-0.1215686274509804,\"wgt\":465091321,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8338879218\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-27\",\"time\":\"00:02:01\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-27T00:02:01Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T00:01:41Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.8235294222831726,\"url\":\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/xiaomi-redmi-note-14-series-is-official-will-go-on-sale-soon.html\",\"title\":\"Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 series is official, will go on sale 'soon'\",\"body\":\"Xiaomi has unveiled the Redmi Note 14 series smartphones.

They are so specific, and when you want one, that desire doesn\\'t go away until you\\'re stuffing one into your mouth, enjoying the interplay of brown sugar-infused dough and pools of chocolate.\\n\\nWhen I get the craving for a chocolate chip cookie, I don\\'t have the taste in my mouth for Chips Ahoy or that giant cookie that moves people to stand in line. Instead, I put on my apron and check that there is butter in the fridge. Somehow I\\'ve convinced myself it\\'s easier than driving to a local bakery, although we have no dearth of terrific options. The only one I can walk to has excellent cookies and a perennial line.\\n\\nThe great benefit to making your own chocolate chip cookie is that you can customize it to your taste. Most of us have particular preferences that fuel our yearning. Do you prefer a chewy or crisp cookie? Are the inclusions bitter, bittersweet, or milk chocolate? Are they discs of couverture chocolate or traditional chips? Do you like nuts in your chippers? Can you wait 24 to 36 hours for the dough to \"age,\" thus ensuring a more flavorful result, or do you need them now?\\n\\nRecipe-wise, I usually go one of two ways. If I\\'m willing to wait just a little bit and work a tiny bit harder, my favorite is Kim Boyce\\'s Whole Wheat Chocolate Chip Cookies from her classic cookbook Good to the Grain. This is a cookie that is surprisingly savory, which may be a strange thing to say about a sweet. But the heartier flavor of whole wheat flour blunts the sugar\\'s sweetness just enough to make the eating experience extremely satisfying. I don\\'t know anyone who doesn\\'t love these cookies once they\\'ve tried them. However, because whole wheat flour still has the germ, which is a source of oil, it goes rancid much more quickly than all-purpose flour. You really need to make sure your supply isn\\'t compromised. It\\'s why people opt to store it in the freezer or refrigerator, where whole wheat flour lasts well for up to six months.\\n\\nBut there are times I don\\'t want to worry about my supply of whole wheat flour. I just want cookies now. And that means I don\\'t even want to take the time to cream the butter and sugar together or take out my mixer. In those urgent cookie moments, I lean on Sally McKenney\\'s recipe for Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies made with melted butter. Making them reminds me of making cookies as a child, stirring everything together in a bowl instead of using a mixer. The combination of melted butter, brown sugar, and a bit of cornstarch ensures the soft and chewy attributes of the cookie. I prefer using a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate couverture discs instead of chips. Couverture is a high-quality chocolate made with a denser concentration of cocoa butter, which gives you those seductive pools of chocolate in the cookie. And if I don\\'t have couverture in the house, I just chop up whatever emergency chocolate bar I may have. I usually buy my couverture locally at Surfas. But if you want to lose your mind with choice, here\\'s a good site.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a tinkerer and love a good story and recipe of a viral cookie, here is the story of the famed New York Times chocolate chip cookie created by pastry giant Jacques Torres and tinkered with by David Leite. It\\'s amongst the New York Times\\' top 20 saved recipes. The surprise ingredient here is bread flour. This cookie is why you started to see salt garnishing cookies everywhere for a while. The recipe calls for aging the dough 36 hours to create complex flavor and greater variation in texture. The bread flour adds chewiness and bend.', 'image': 'https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/election-film-baking/chocolate-chip-cookies/@@images/rectangular_image/page-header?v=1727391949.77', 'sentiment': 0.1686274509803922, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878132', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:00:04Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-26T23:59:53Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.ashcroftcachecreekjournal.com/home2/west-kootenay-ferries-to-keep-operating-as-labour-dispute-goes-to-mediation-7558932', 'title': 'West Kootenay ferries to keep operating as labour dispute goes to mediation', 'body': 'The union representing ferry employees had previously issued a 72-hour strike notice\\n\\nFerries in the West Kootenay will remain in operation as labour bargaining for a new collective agreement turns to mediation.\\n\\nThe B.C.

Credit: YouTube.\\n\\nThe latest film releases are Megalopolis, Wolfs, The Wild Robot, and Saturday Night. Weighing in are Christy Lemire, film critic for RogerEbert.com and co-host of the YouTube channel Breakfast All Day, and Tim Grierson, senior U.S. critic for Screen International and the author of This Is How You Make a Movie.\\n\\nMegalopolis\\n\\nFrancis Ford Coppola has been working on this passion project since the early 1980s. It got a four-minute standing ovation when it debuted at the Cannes Film Festival. In the sci-fi thriller, Adam Driver plays a visionary architect who takes on a corrupt mayor played by Giancarlo Esposito. The story takes place in a futuristic metropolis trying to rebuild after a natural disaster.\\n\\nLemire: \"[Coppola] reportedly sold a bunch of his ... big wine business to raise the $120 million to get it made, which is always the first mistake in making movies, right? You don\\'t use your own money. But he meant to do this for so long. It was so meaningful to him.\\n\\nIt is this two and a half hour, ambitious, big swing with this giant cast. ... Adam Driver is this brilliant and visionary architect named Cesar Catilina. He has this image of New Rome, which is essentially New York City as this gleaming metropolis. And he lives inside the top of the Chrysler Building, and that\\'s his apartment/workspace. He has the ability to stop time, which is a thing that they don\\'t really use all that effectively. He is clashing with the mayor ... Giancarlo Esposito. And the woman in between them is the mayor\\'s daughter, played by Nathalie Emmanuel. She is drawn to both of these men for their ideas about how the world should be.\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of speechifying here. Adam Driver is saddled with big, chunky blocks of exposition and hammering us over the head with Coppola\\'s philosophy. So it\\'s very talky, but it\\'s also dazzlingly beautiful at times, it\\'s intentionally heightened in its artificiality. But it\\'s all different kinds of movies slammed together and made these wild tonal shifts. So I was never bored, but it\\'s a total mess.\"\\n\\nGrierson: \"I don\\'t take any pleasure in saying I don\\'t think the movie works very much at all. You can feel Coppola\\'s passion and his sadness. Obviously, this movie is supposed to be a metaphor for America, and a dying America, and a dying democracy. And you can feel the decades of anguish that went into this film in terms of how he feels about America, and how America is essentially the modern Roman Empire that\\'s losing its way, and is collapsing into hedonism and sensationalism.\\n\\nBut that passion that Coppola feels, I don\\'t think translates into a very compelling story. I don\\'t think it translates into many compelling performances. I think Adam Driver is okay in the film. ... Characters are representing different ideas in the movie. They\\'re symbols. They\\'re not really people in this movie. And I think that\\'s a big problem.\\n\\n... I don\\'t think people are going to come back and say, \\'No, this is an amazing movie.\\' I don\\'t want to recommend people see the movie because I don\\'t think it\\'s good. But it does remind me of those 1970s movies, where American auteurs really just put their heart and souls into their movies. There\\'s a part of me that\\'s like, if you want to support adventurous, doing-it-your-way cinema, give it a try. But I think most people will be disappointed in the experience.\"\\n\\nWolfs\\n\\nBrad Pitt and George Clooney play fixers who typically work alone, and now they\\'re hired as a team to cover up a high-profile crime.\\n\\nGrierson: \"If you are a fan of the Oceans 11 series that Steven Soderbergh directed, I think that you will like Wolfs, though it is not to that level. It\\'s written in directed by Jon Watts, who most recently has been doing the Spider-Man movies. ... It\\'s a very light-hearted crime thriller comedy where the two main characters bicker back and forth. They don\\'t like each other, they don\\'t have partners. They work alone, but eventually have a begrudging respect for each other as they realize that they have to work together to figure out what the heck is going on. ... It definitely feels like a movie that you can watch at home and enjoy.\"\\n\\nLemire: \"This is not even a thing you need to watch on your couch. ... I would say this is exactly what airplane movies are for -- is to have just the light distraction of attractive A-list stars bantering with each other. There is some visual flair to it. The cinematographer also shot Everything Everywhere All At Once, and so there is some high-end sheen to it. It looks pretty great. And these guys look pretty great for being early mid-60s. They are well preserved. And of course, the camera loves them, but they are very much phoning this in. They\\'re not doing any heavy lifting. They\\'re not lifting anything. They are showing up and being charming.\"\\n\\nThe Wild Robot\\n\\nThis animated feature is from Dreamworks, based on the 2016 novel of the same name. Lupita Nyong\\'o voices a robot who gets shipwrecked on a remote island, where she develops relationships with the native animals.\\n\\nLemire: \"It is breathtakingly beautiful. ... It feels like hands touched it. There is a tactile quality to the colors and the animation. It feels like you\\'re looking at fresh strokes. It\\'s gorgeous over and over again.\\n\\n... It\\'s meant for adults and also for little kids, and it works well on both levels, in that way. And it\\'s a lot of fun, and surprisingly, a little twisted and weird and dark. I really loved a lot of the humor from the beginning, and then it gets super heavy-handed and treacly in the third act, and it spells everything out.\"\\n\\nGrierson: \"Chris Sanders, who wrote and directed this, who had done the first How to Train Your Dragon, he has talked about the fact that Hayao Miyazaki was a real influence on the film, especially Miyazaki\\'s depictions of the natural world. ...

And the movie actually reveals these things in really interesting ways.\\n\\n... The third act, my only reservation was more that I think it gets more actiony. The emotional stuff didn\\'t bother me because I think I was very much on the wavelength of the film. And it\\'s a movie really ... about motherhood. But it\\'s also a movie about de facto families, the families that you create, as opposed to the ones that you were born in to. And that\\'s really very touching and really closely observed. So in terms of recent, mainstream animated movies, I think this is one of the better ones that have come along. ...

It is not a documentary.\\n\\nGrierson: \"This is an Aaron Sorkin, like everybody-walk-around-and-talk-fast kind of thing. It\\'s almost done as if it\\'s in real time. ... It\\'s the last 90 minutes before the very first episode of Saturday Night Live ... is going to hit the air. And we\\'re watching as Lorne Michaels, played by Gabriel LaBelle ... is desperately trying to put out 10,000 fires; in one case, a literal fire. ... And there\\'s also the superficial nostalgic pleasure of watching actors, for the most part, really do dead-on impressions of the comedy stars that we know so well. Cory Michael Smith is a stunning Chevy Chase, Dylan O\\'Brien is really good as Dan Aykroyd.\\n\\nMy reservations about the movie are just -- I think that beyond the superficial pleasures, there\\'s nothing much deeper going on, though. I think Jason Reitman wants us to feel like something deeper is going on, but I think the movie is a little too superficial, a little too glib. It never really digs into its characters.\"\\n\\nLemire: \"What\\'s interesting about ... how incredible the casting is and how dead on the performances are, they\\'re playing our ideas of the personas of these people, right?

The condition is characterised by red, scaly patches that impact the quality of a patient\\'s life and can sometimes be life-threatening.\\n\\nNew research strongly suggests the hormone hepcidin may trigger the onset of the condition. This marks the first time hepcidin has been considered a potential causal factor. In mammals, hepcidin is responsible for regulating iron levels in the body.\\n\\nThe international research team behind this discovery -- which includes Dr Charareh Pourzand from the Department of Life Sciences, the Centre for Therapeutic Innovation and the Centre for Bioengineering and Biomedical Technologies at the University of Bath in the UK -- hopes their finding will lead to the development of new drugs able to block the action of the hormone.\\n\\nThose most likely to benefit from such a treatment are patients with pustular psoriasis (PP) -- a particularly severe and treatment-resistant form of the disease that can affect a patient\\'s nails and joints as well as skin.\\n\\nDr Pourzand, who studies ways to mitigate iron imbalances in the skin, said: \"Psoriasis is a life-changing dermatological disease. Patients face a potentially disfiguring and lifelong affliction that profoundly affects their lives, causing them both physical discomfort and emotional distress. The condition can also lead to other serious health conditions.\\n\\n\"A new treatment targeting iron hormone imbalance in the skin offers hope. This innovative approach could significantly enhance the quality of life for millions, restoring their confidence and wellbeing.\"\\n\\nWe need skin iron -- but not too much\\n\\nIron is an essential trace metal, not just for transporting oxygen through the body\\'s circulatory system but also for maintaining healthy skin: it\\'s involved in many essential cellular functions, including wound healing, collagen production and immune function. However, iron overload in the skin can be harmful, amplifying the damaging effects of UV sunlight and causing hyperproliferative chronic diseases (where cells grow and multiply more than normal), including psoriasis.\\n\\nStudies going back 50 years have reported high iron concentrations in the skin cells of psoriatic patients, however the cause of this excess and its significance to the condition have remained unclear until now.\\n\\nThe new study -- published in the high-impact academic journal Nature Communications -- is the first to name hepcidin as the likely link.\\n\\nHepcidin is responsible for controlling how much iron is absorbed from food and later released into the body. In healthy individuals, it\\'s produced exclusively in the liver, however the new study has found that in people with psoriasis, the hormone is also generated in the skin.\\n\\nExposure to hepcidin triggers iron overload\\n\\nIn the new study, mice (which have many genetic and physiological similarities to humans) developed a rodent form of psoriasis after being exposed to high levels of skin-produced hepcidin.\\n\\nThis over-abundance of the hormone caused the animals\\' skin cells to retain far more iron than was required. In turn, this excess iron triggered both a hyperproliferation of skin cells and an abnormally high concentration of inflammation-inducing neutrophils (a type of immune system cell) in the topmost layer of skin.\\n\\nThese two outcomes -- an overproduction of skin cells and an abundance of neutrophils -- are main features of human psoriasis.\\n\\nPsoriasis runs in families though experts believe \\'environmental\\' factors such as weight, infections and smoking are also triggers.\\n\\nA disease with no cure\\n\\nCurrently there is no cure for psoriasis, though treatments that include topical creams, light therapy and oral drugs can help keep symptoms under control for patients with some forms of the condition. Recent treatments have focused on targeting the immune pathways that contribute to psoriasis developing.\\n\\nDr Pourzand believes a drug targeting hepcidin has the potential to dramatically improve treatment options for all psoriasis patients.\\n\\nShe said: \"Our data strongly suggests hepcidin would be a good target for skin psoriasis treatment. A drug that can control this hormone could be used to treat flare-ups and keep patients in remission to prevent recurrence.\\n\\n\"Also, by adjusting the excess iron in psoriatic skin with customised iron chelators (substances that bind to excess iron in the body and help remove it), we would aim to halt the uncontrolled proliferation of psoriatic skin cells. This hyperproliferation is a major focus of our laboratory\\'s research on psoriasis therapy, conducted in collaboration with national and international scientists from the Skin@Bath Network, including those from this study.\"\\n\\nDr William Tillett, a senior lecturer at the University of Bath and a consultant rheumatologist specialising in the diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis, said: \"This research from Dr Pourzand and colleagues is an exciting step forward for people living with psoriasis and for the clinical teams treating them.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t know exactly why people develop psoriasis but the identification of hepcidin as an important factor in the development of the disease opens doors not only to potential new treatments but also to the possibility of preventing the disease developing in people at high risk. Existing drugs -- called biologics -- can be highly effective but they are costly and rationed in the UK. Furthermore, these drugs don\\'t work for everyone and they can stop working after a while, so a new approach to treatment would be very welcome.\"\\n\\nHe added: \"However, developing drugs is notoriously time consuming and costly, so a new treatment won\\'t be available immediately and it\\'s important for patients to manage expectations.\"\\n\\nDr Penelope Pratsou, a consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the UK charity the British Skin Foundation, said: \"The findings of this study shed new light on the pathophysiology of psoriasis, with hepcidin overabundance in psoriatic skin thought to be another culprit. These results appear promising for patients, though more research is required to further elucidate the role of hepcidin and its potential as a prospective treatment target in psoriasis.\"', 'image': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png', 'sentiment': 0.05882352941176472, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878192', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:00:19Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-26T23:59:55Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.5647059082984924, 'url': 'https://www.eurasiareview.com/27092024-the-houthi-attacks-in-the-red-sea-impact-on-yemen-analysis/', 'title': 'The Houthi Attacks In The Red Sea: Impact On Yemen - Analysis', 'body': 'By Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA)\\n\\nThe involvement of the Houthis in the Israel-Hamas war has affected the progress of the negotiations between the internationally recognised government of Yemen and the Houthis. The intra-Yemeni dialogue which was advancing since the agreement between the government of Yemen and the Houthis in April 2022 and the rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran in March 2023, is now facing hurdles. The conflict has created new obstacles in the intra-Yemeni dialogue, slowing the pace of talks and further eroding trust among the parties. The delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people is also disrupted. The Houthis have detained a number of UN officials, diplomatic and international NGO staff working in Yemen. Besides, they have also seized ships and detained crew members who continue to be under Houthi custody. These developments are also worsening Yemen\\'s political, security and economic situation, making the prospects for peace more tenuous.\\n\\nAfter long drawn out negotiations, in April 2022, a two-month UN-mediated ceasefire agreement was signed between the Yemeni government and the Houthis. The parties agreed to stop their military offensive, allow fuel ships to the Hodeida port, and resume flight operations from Sanaa to Egypt and Jordan.1 As a result, the situation improved significantly, although sporadic instances of violence were still reported. The drop in instances of armed clashes and casualties was a positive and tangible achievement for Yemen since the beginning of the war in 2015. The agreement was renewed in June and August 2022 for two months each time. However, it could not be extended beyond October 2022 due to differences between the parties.\\n\\nIn March 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran signed a landmark normalisation agreement, which had a positive impact on the situation in Yemen. For the first time since the beginning of the Saudi-led military intervention in 2015, both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis showed a willingness to engage in dialogue and address their longstanding conflict. This led to several rounds of negotiations, including a visit by a Houthi delegation to Riyadh, where they met the Saudi Defence Minister. Saudi officials later described the discussions as positive, with both parties expressing optimism about reaching a mutually acceptable resolution to their disputes.\\n\\nThe internal security situation in Yemen also improved following the rapprochement, with a marked reduction in violence. The UN voiced its support for the talks between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis, expressing hope that a comprehensive peace agreement could be achieved. The engagement between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis was seen as a crucial step towards resolving the conflict in Yemen and stabilising the region.\\n\\nIn April 2023, around 900 prisoners were released from both sides, after the Government of Yemen and the Houthis agreed to a prisoner swap deal. In the same month, Saudi and Omani officials visited Sanaa and held mediatory discussions with the stakeholders. In September 2023, a Houthi delegation visited Riyadh for the first time, since the beginning of the war in Yemen, for discussion with the Saudi officials. At a time when it looked like the peace talks were moving in the right direction, Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, and subsequently Israel declared war on Hamas and attacked Gaza.\\n\\nAs the war broke out between Israel and Hamas, the Houthis declared their support for Palestine and joined the war against Israel. They started targeting the commercial ships in the Red Sea, which they believed were linked to Israel. Later, they targeted ships in the Red Sea, which were not linked to Israel at all. This created tensions in the waters of the Red Sea. A 20-nation military coalition led by the US named \\'Operation Prosperity Guardian\\' was formed to ensure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. The UK and the US, since then, have undertaken several attacks on the Houthi targets inside Yemen. The Operation Prosperity Guardian has been successful to a large extent in deterring Houthi attacks on the vessels in the Red Sea.\\n\\nThe Houthis launched several rockets and UAVs towards Israel. Some of them have hit their targets in the southern port city of Eilat. As a result of the attacks, the operations at the Eilat port have been closed since November 2023.2 In a major retaliatory attack, Israel hit an oil facility in Hodeida. The Houthis have only limited capability to hurt Israel physically, but their involvement in the War has affected the peace process in Yemen significantly.\\n\\nThere is a growing concern among the regional stakeholders and the UN that the Houthi involvement in the war could jeopardise the progress made so far in the Yemeni peace process since April 2022. The UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Hans Grundberg, expressed his apprehension that the Yemeni peace talks should not be a \\'collateral damage\\' of the Israel-Hamas war.3 The UN has urged the Houthis to adhere to the agreements made and de-escalate the tensions to prevent any negative impact on the peace process in Yemen. In the March 2024 UN Security Council Monthly Forecast for Yemen, Grundberg stated that the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have \"stalled-and risk upending-Yemen\\'s peace talks\".4 He also noted that there is a growing armed clashes and violence in Yemen.\\n\\nIn December 2023, after a number of parleys in Saudi Arabia and Oman, Yemeni parties committed to a ceasefire and agreed to a roadmap. Elements of this roadmap included resumption of oil exports (a major source of revenue for the economy), payment of salaries of civil servants, opening of roads in Taiz and easing restrictions on Sanaa Airport and the Hodeida port.5 But in March 2024, as the Houthis stepped up their attacks in the Red Sea, the Yemeni government suspended the implementation of this roadmap.\\n\\nThe internationally recognised government of Yemen has severely condemned the activities of the Houthis in the Red Sea. It has described the Houthi attack on the ships in the Red Sea as \"systematic terrorism\" and says that the Houthi actions would lead to economic and environmental disaster in the region.6 The Yemeni government alleges that by escalating attacks in the Red Sea, the Houthis have undermined the ongoing political process in the country. It also accuses Iran of supplying weapons to the Houthis which leads to the worsening of humanitarian crisis.7 Besides, the Yemeni government accuses the Houthis of imposing an economic siege as the number of ships carrying humanitarian assistance to Yemen has decreased as well.8\\n\\nThere is a fundamental difference in the thinking between the Yemeni government and the Houthis. While the Yemeni government believes that the State and its institutions must be strengthened to provide security and humanitarian access to the people, the Houthis do not want to lose control of the areas and cede any authority to the former.\\n\\nThe US, while remaining engaged in the peace process, has taken military action against the Houthis for their disruptive activities in the Red Sea. In January 2024, as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea increased, the US announced the designation of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group. For the US, Houthi attacks on the vessels in the Red Sea are acts of terrorism.9 The US states that these attacks must stop for the peace talks to progress without any hurdles. The US has stated that the Houthi attacks have not only affected the regional countries but the Yemeni people as well. It has expressed its apprehension that the escalation in the region will have a negative impact on the peace talks in Yemen.\\n\\nOman and Saudi Arabia share land borders with Yemen and have significant stakes in the resolution of the conflict. Saudi Arabia, having fought a prolonged military campaign against the Houthis since 2015, finds itself in a complex geopolitical and security situation. Despite the recent escalation in the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia has refrained from taking a more forceful stance against the Houthis. This delicate balancing act reflects the nuanced position of Saudi Arabia towards the conflict in its neighbourhood. Saudi position can be understood from the fact that it has engaged with the Houthis in negotiations and does not want any military confrontation which would derail the achievements made in this regard.\\n\\nOman has been mediating between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis and making diplomatic efforts to reach a political solution. Muscat has condemned the Israeli attack on the Houthis stating that it will further escalate and complicate the situation. In response to the Houthi attacks, the US and the UK launched a number of rocket and UAV attacks on the Houthi military targets inside Yemen. Oman has condemned these targeted attacks and expressed its concern over the attacks by \"friendly countries\".10 Despite the deteriorating situation and involvement of the Houthis in the war against Israel, Oman and Saudi Arabia want to preserve the progress made in their engagement with the Houthis.\\n\\nApart from the attack on vessels in the Red Sea, the Houthis have undertaken several provocative actions which threaten to derail the relative peace achieved in the country since April 2022. There are reports of increasing mobilisation of troops and occurrence of violent armed clashes in several parts of the country and the overall security environment remains unpredictable. This can potentially flare up the situation and seriously deteriorate the conditions.\\n\\nIn June 2024, the Houthis seized three Yemenia Airlines planes in Sanaa. This resulted in hundreds of pilgrims getting stranded in Riyadh as these planes would have carried them back home. The Yemeni government accused the Houthis of escalation while the Houthis alleged the government of \\'plundering the company\\'s revenues\\'.11\\n\\nIn June 2024, Houthis detained 11 UN personnel from different parts of the country. They have also abducted a number of Yemenis working for humanitarian organisations and aid agencies in Yemen. The Houthis suspect the involvement of these people in an espionage network providing vital military intelligence to the US and Israel.12 Despite the appeal from the UN Secretary-General for their unconditional release, the Houthis have still kept them hostage.\\n\\nOn 3 August, Houthis seized the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) headquarters in Sanaa. After more than two weeks, they handed the office back to the UN on 19 August. Such unilateral and provocative actions by the Houthis at a time when substantial gains have been achieved are major challenges for re-establishing peace and stability in the country. It also creates impediments to the smooth delivery of humanitarian assistance to the millions of Yemenis who are in dire need of aid for their survival.\\n\\nYemen\\'s economy remains highly fragile and reviving economic life is a priority for the country. Political unity and stability of the country is necessary to revive the economy. With the Houthi attacks on the Red Sea and slowed down peace talks, the economy of the country continues to suffer. Oil exports, a major revenue source, have been severely impacted by the prolonged conflict in the country. Due to the damage to the oil infrastructure during the war and the absence of foreign investment in the energy sector, Yemen\\'s economy has been deeply affected. Infrastructure throughout the country remains damaged and needs to be rebuilt. In such a bleak economic condition, the Houthi involvement in the Israel-Hamas war presents an additional obstacle further hindering Yemen\\'s prospects for economic recovery.\\n\\nIn July 2024, a significant step forward was made as both parties reached an agreement to cooperate on two critical issues: Yemenia Airways and the country\\'s banking sector. Both sides agreed to implement measures aimed at unifying the Yemeni Central Bank, a crucial step for economic stabilisation. Additionally, they agreed to resume air connectivity to Jordan, Egypt and India.13 These two recent developments mark important progress towards restoring essential services and improving the economic landscape in the country.\\n\\nOver a decade of instability in Yemen has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with more than 18.2 million people, including 9.8 million children, in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.14 The ongoing civil war has disrupted education, leaving millions of children out of school. Diseases such as cholera have spread across large parts of the country. The escalating tensions in the Red Sea have further impacted the delivery of vital aid, as vessels carrying humanitarian supplies face increasing challenges. At this critical juncture, a nationwide ceasefire and a consensus on a national roadmap for the future political process are essential to stabilise the country and address its pressing needs. The escalation by the Houthis significantly, hampers the aid delivery to the people.\\n\\nIndia is highly concerned about the recent developments in the Red Sea and Yemen. India has huge economic and strategic interests in the safety and security of the Sea lines of Communication in the Red Sea, the Strait of Bab el Mandab and the Gulf of Aden. Any disruption to this vital maritime route affects India\\'s economy and security. Besides, India remains wary of the potential resurgence of piracy off the Somali coast. India has maintained a continuous naval presence in the Gulf of Aden since 2008 to counter piracy activities. Indian Navy has provided security to a large number of commercial vessels passing in the region from piracy attacks.15 Further, a large number of international commercial vessels have Indian crew members who often face difficulties when the ships are seized or hijacked. This is another area of concern for India.\\n\\nThroughout the crisis in Yemen, India has supported the government and the people of the country. India has provided food, medicines and other humanitarian aid to Yemen. India is also concerned with the activities of terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS in Yemen who get a safe haven because of the conducive environment in the country.16\\n\\nPresently, India recognises the Aden-based Presidential Leadership Council. India has repeatedly appealed for a Yemeni-led and Yemeni-owned political process to build a future roadmap for the country.17 A united and stable Yemen is a positive for India from political, economic and security viewpoints. After a long gap, India has now appointed a non-resident ambassador to Yemen. On its part, India has always offered to provide all possible support to Yemen in navigating the crisis. There is a huge potential for economic engagement with Yemen, which could be explored once the situation stabilises.\\n\\nYemen is facing multiple crises, and the involvement of Houthis in the Israel-Hamas War has further dampened the prospects of peace. The situation in the Red Sea, aggravated by the Houthi attacks, has added further complexity to the mediation efforts and weakened the potential for a peaceful resolution in Yemen. The Houthis\\' actions in the Red Sea have also raised doubts among mediators regarding their commitment to the peace process, deepening the trust deficit. While the UN, along with the US, Saudi Arabia and Oman, has played a pivotal role in bringing the Yemeni parties to the negotiating table and achieving a relative calm, there is a growing concern that the Houthis\\' involvement in the Israel-Hamas War could undermine years of diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring peace and unity in Yemen.\\n\\nViews expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Manohar Parrikar IDSA or of the Government of India.\\n\\nAbout the author: Dr Prasanta Kumar Pradhan is Research Fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.', 'image': 'https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/b-66.jpeg', 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878125', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:00:19Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-26T23:59:51Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.nbcboston.com/news/national-international/rudy-giuliani-disbarred-in-dc-after-pushing-trumps-false-2020-election-claims/3501370/', 'title': \"Rudy Giuliani disbarred in DC after pushing Trump's false 2020 election claims\", 'body': 'Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was disbarred in Washington, D.C., Thursday, months after he lost his law license in New York for pursuing false claims that then-President Donald Trump made about his 2020 presidential election loss.\\n\\nThe brief ruling from D.C.\\'s appeals court said Giuliani did not respond to an order to explain why he should not be disbarred in Washington after he was in New York last summer.\\n\\nTed Goodman, a spokesperson for Giuliani, called the decision \"an absolute travesty and a total miscarriage of justice.\" Giuliani has argued that he believed the claims he was making on behalf of the Trump campaign were true.\\n\\n\"Members of the legal community who want to protect the integrity of our justice system should immediately speak out against this partisan, politically motivated decision,\" Goodman said in a text message.\\n\\nIt\\'s the latest blow to the man once lauded as \"America\\'s mayor.\" His advocacy of Trump\\'s false election claims has also led to criminal charges.

After a Week 3 loss to the reigning Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, here are a few keys to what the Falcons must accomplish to get back in the win column and to a .500 record.\\n\\nThe pass rush must wake up and get to Derek Carr early\\n\\nDefensive coordinator Jimmy Lake's defense has been good, but they need to improve in the pass rush department. Out of 32 NFL teams, the Falcons rank 31st with only three sacks on the season.\\n\\nWhile edge defender Matt Judon accounts for half of the team's sack total, one would hope he can make a more significant impact on Sunday. Additionally, no one on the team, sans Grady Jarrett, has yet to generate more than five-total pressures on the season.\\n\\nSimply put, they must get to Saints veteran quarterback Derek Carr, who has repeatedly shown that he is prone to turnovers under pressure. With Carr missing a valuable offensive lineman, the pass rush has no excuse not to produce in Week 4.\\n\\nThe Falcons Podcast: Spotify | Apple Pods | iHeart\\n\\nThe defense must focus on containing running back Alvin Kamara\\n\\nLike Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley, in Week 2, head coach Raheem Morris faces another back who has shown he can take over games in 2024.\\n\\nIn three games for New Orleans, Alvin Kamara has finished north of 100 total yards from scrimmage in each contest. Additionally, he has five total touchdowns on the season, four coming in the team's Week 2 victory against the Dallas Cowboys.\\n\\nAtlanta's defense has only allowed one rushing touchdown on the season - tied with the league's best defense: the Pittsburgh Steelers.\\n\\nThe team must keep up the quality work this week against a back who has a nose for the endzone, whether as a rusher or receiver. Kamara is listed as questionable on the Saints' injury report, but Atlanta must prepare as if he's going to play.\\n\\nThe offense must commit to running the football to win the time of possession battle\\n\\nAn area that needs improvement for Atlanta offensive coordinator Zac Robinson is his commitment to running the football. On the season, his unit ranks 18th in the NFL with 75 rushing attempts. Last week, the team was one-dimensional, with only 16 attempts for Bijan Robinson and seven for Tyler Allgeier.\\n\\nThis week, they face a Saints defense that allows opposing rushers 4.5 yards per carry. With an offensive line missing two starters, the playbook may be missing long-developing pass plays. If that is the case, more attempts on the ground will assist with gelling new starters into the offensive front.\\n\\nMoreover, more rushing attempts can wear down New Orleans's defense and keep quality pass rushers Cam Jordan and Carl Granderson from teeing off on veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins.\\n\\nFalcons must finish offensive drives in the red zone.\\n\\nLast week, the Falcons' offense stalled when it mattered most at the end of the game. The team's playmakers must step up when they reach the opposition's 20-yard line. The Falcons are 22nd in the NFL in touchdown percentage once in the red zone.\\n\\nWith up-and-coming talents Drake London and Kyle Pitts, there is no reason why the offense should not target them more often near the goal line. At 6-4 and 6-6, respectively, both players possess 'freakish' physical frames with elite athletic abilities. While London has six targets and two touchdown receptions on the year, Pitts only has three targets and one touchdown in the red zone.\\n\\nThis week, seeing both players getting the ball more in the red zone would boost the team's chances of winning.\", 'image': 'https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1919,h_1079,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/falcon_report/01j8rb8jw30z6qdfdh8y.jpg', 'sentiment': 0.1450980392156862, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878021', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:00:30Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-26T23:59:36Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.9960784316062927, 'url': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240926131929.htm', 'title': \"Scientists discover important blood pressure 'switch'\", 'body': 'These cells include smooth muscle cells, which line our arteries. Normally, smooth muscle cells help control blood pressure by contracting and relaxing. But when blood pressure levels decrease significantly and for long periods, smooth muscle cells in the kidney, and some other kidney cell types, can take on a whole new job: producing renin, a substance typically manufactured in specialized cells in the kidneys to help maintain blood pressure.\\n\\nScientists have been uncertain what genomic triggers regulate this sudden shift to renin production, but the UVA researchers have found answers, identifying a crucial biological \"switch\" that controls the changeover and explains the cells\\' secret superpower.\\n\\n\"Discovering how the switch works will help us understand how our bodies control blood pressure,\" said researcher R. Ariel Gomez, MD, of UVA\\'s Child Health Research Center. \"Knowing how vascular cells change their identity could help develop new medications to treat high blood pressure and vascular diseases.\"\\n\\nUnderstanding Blood Pressure\\n\\nGomez and his collaborator Maria Luisa S. Sequeira-Lopez, MD, are leading researchers into the role of renin in blood-pressure control. For their latest investigation, they worked with UVA senior scientist Jason P. Smith, PhD, and collaborators to better understand how certain cells can suddenly remember how to make renin long after they have stopped doing so.\\n\\nThe UVA team identified several biological mechanisms involved in this transformation. For example, the researchers identified nine genes that play key roles in the three biological \"pathways\" that regulate renin production. These genes are responsible for causing smooth muscle cells to stop producing renin and for triggering them to resume when needed. The scientists note that while such cells stop producing renin naturally, they remain \"poised\" to jump back into action.\\n\\nFurther, the scientists discovered factors that trigger the genes to resume renin production. This \"epigenetic\" switch is the lynchpin to understanding how renin production is controlled in these cells that don\\'t normally produce renin.\\n\\n\"We expected to find the region in your genome where this gene is located to be inaccessible when renin is turned off, but it turns out this spot stays generally accessible in cells that are ready to be called into action when more renin is needed,\" Smith said. \"Ultimately, since renin is so critical for our own health, a better understanding of how our bodies control its production may prove foundational to how we treat hypertension [high blood pressure] and the long-term effects of common blood pressure medications on kidney function and disease.\"\\n\\nThe UVA researchers\\' work provides a comprehensive map of this form of renin regulation, they note in a new scientific paper. The findings give important direction to future research, they say, and could provide important insights into the progression of dangerous kidney damage called fibrosis. It\\'s possible, they say, that targeting the renin-control processes could lead to new treatments for high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.\\n\\n\"Now we want to identify markers and potential targets to mitigate and hopefully control unwanted effects of chronic stimulation of the renin cells,\" Sequeira-Lopez said. \"It is crucial to understand the basic secrets of our cells to design more and more effective therapies with less or no adverse effects.\"\\n\\nThe research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, grants P50DK096373, R01DK116718 and R01HL148044.', 'image': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png', 'sentiment': 0.1294117647058823, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338877980', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:00:30Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-26T23:59:31Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://newsday.co.tt/2024/09/26/opposition-leader-persad-bissessar-improve-lives-of-soldiers/', 'title': 'Opposition Leader Persad-Bissessar: Improve lives of soldiers -

He shook and trembled on the gurney for about two minutes with his body at times pulling against the restraints. That was followed by about six minutes of gasping breathing.\\n\\nMiller was convicted of killing three men -- Lee Holdbrooks, Christopher Scott Yancy and Terry Jarvis -- in 1999 and the state had previously attempted to execute him by lethal injection in 2022.\\n\\nThe execution was the second to use the new method Alabama first employed in January, when Kenneth Smith was put to death. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the inmate\\'s face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.\\n\\nAlabama officials and advocates have argued over whether Smith suffered an unconstitutional level of pain during his execution after he shook in seizure-like spasms for more than two minutes while strapped to the gurney and then gasped for breath for several minutes.\\n\\nMiller was one of five inmates scheduled to be put to death in the span of one week, an unusually high number that defies a yearslong trend of decline in the use of the death penalty in the U.S.\\n\\nA delivery truck driver, Miller was convicted of capital murder for the Aug. 5, 1999, shootings that claimed three lives and shocked the city of Pelham, a suburban city just south of Birmingham.\\n\\nPolice say that early that morning, Miller entered Ferguson Enterprises and fatally shot two co-workers: Holdbrooks, 32, and Yancy, 28.

Prop 33 would expand rent control in the state, but it\\'s sponsored by an organization that isn\\'t widely known as a housing advocate: the LA-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The measure, however, has sparked pushback from California\\'s landlord lobby in the form of Prop 34. The initiative is billed as a health care reform measure, but its real motive appears to be to cut off funding for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\\n\\nWhat exactly is Prop 33?\\n\\nThis initiative would allow cities to expand their local rent control rules to cover more apartments and homes.\\n\\nIt does that by repealing a 1995 state law called the Costa-Hawkins Rental Act, which currently prevents cities from regulating rents on certain properties, like single-family homes and new housing.\\n\\nProp 33 would also let cities pass tougher rent control laws, including limits on how much landlords can raise their rents each time a tenant moves out. That\\'s not allowed under the current state law.\\n\\nSupporters of the law include the California Democratic Party, Unite Here Local 11, and the California Nurses Association. The LA County Board of Supervisors voted 3-1 in support of the ballot initiative.\\n\\nSo far, 51% of likely voters say they will vote for Proposition 33, according to recent polling from the Public Policy Institute of California.\\n\\nWhy is the AIDS Healthcare Foundation so interested in rent control?\\n\\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation CEO Michael Weinstein says housing efforts are an extension of the organization\\'s overall mission, because access to housing is a major determinant of overall health. In 2017, AHF started purchasing old buildings, including single-room occupancy hotels in Skid Row -- like The King Edward Hotel and The Baltimore Hotel -- and turning them into low-income hotels.\\n\\nThis is the third time the group, which has an annual budget of around $2.5 billion, is putting this issue before LA voters. In total, the AHF has spent more than $150 million backing various ballot measures, including statewide rent control propositions in 2018 and 2020, as well as local and state measures requiring condoms in pornographic films.\\n\\nSo how does the organization have such a large budget? It provides access to medical care for approximately 2 million patients across 17 states and 47 countries. The majority of their revenue comes from a network of 62 pharmacies.\\n\\nThe AHF is also enrolled in a federal program, called 340B that allows providers that serve low-income or at-risk patients to buy drugs at a discount, bill insurance companies at full price, and use that revenue to expand their mission. The 340B law doesn\\'t specify how exactly that revenue garnered from drug discounts must be spent.\\n\\nAHF has used some of that money to sponsor ballot measures. But the backers of Proposition 34 argue that this money should be spent on patients, not on politics.\\n\\nWhat, then, is Prop 34?\\n\\nThis initiative, billed as the \"Protect Patients Now Act,\" would require certain health care providers using that discount drug program to use at least 98% of their net drug sale revenue on what\\'s described as \"direct patient care.\"\\n\\nBut Prop 34 only applies to 340B providers who meet some very specific conditions. They must have spent more than $100 million on things other than direct patient care in the last decade, and also own and operate apartment buildings that have been collectively cited for at least 500 health and safety violations.\\n\\nAs far as most people can tell, the only organization that meets these criteria is the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\\n\\nThe proposition is sponsored by the California Apartment Association, a lobbying group for apartment owners and managers.\\n\\nThis proposition has support from 53% of likely voters, according to recent polling from the Public Policy Institute of California.\\n\\nSo is Proposition 34 directly targeting the AIDS Healthcare Foundation?\\n\\nWhile backers of Prop 34 claim this would likely apply to a few different providers, it appears to only apply to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. AHF has dubbed Prop 34 \"the revenge measure.\"', 'image': 'https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/election-film-baking/prop-33-34/@@images/rectangular_image/page-header?v=1727390923.44', 'sentiment': 0.2, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878314', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:00:38Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T00:00:10Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.hjnews.com/sports/nation/houstons-yordan-alvarez-improving-but-isnt-sure-when-hell-return-from-sprained-right-knee/article_a11b989b-42d9-55f7-b342-b5fb7355853a.html', 'title': \"Houston's Yordan Alvarez improving but isn't sure when he'll return from sprained right knee\", 'body': 'HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston slugger Yordan Alvarez is feeling better after spraining his right knee this weekend but isn\\'t sure when he\\'ll be able to return.\\n\\n\"I wish I knew what was going to happen in the next few days or had a vision for what was going to happen in the next few days,\" he said in Spanish through a translator. \"But we need to wait for the inflammation to go down and then we can go from there.\"\\n\\nAlvarez was injured sliding into second base on a double in the third inning Sunday.

'look twice, forgive once' can sustain social cooperation\", 'body': 'The theory of indirect reciprocity holds that people who earn a good reputation by helping others are more likely to be rewarded by third parties, but widespread cooperation depends on agreement about reputations. In most theoretical models examining how reputations impact people\\'s desire to cooperate with one another, reputations are binary -- good or bad -- and based on limited information. But there is a lot of information available about people\\'s behavior in today\\'s world, especially with social media.\\n\\nBiology professors Joshua B. Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania and Corina Tarnita of Princeton University lead teams that have been collaborating on theoretical research about cooperation. Sebastián Michel-Mata, a doctoral student in Tarnita\\'s lab, came up with the idea of addressing how to judge someone in an information-rich environment.\\n\\n\"The current theory of indirect reciprocity suggests that reputations can only work in a few societies, those with complex norms of judgment and public institutions that can enforce agreement,\" Michel-Mata says. But, as an anthropologist, he sees that such societies are the exception and not the rule, and he wondered about the simple idea that reputations are summaries of multiple actions.\\n\\n\"Prior models have typically assumed that a single action determines someone\\'s reputation, but I think there\\'s more nuance to how we assign reputations to people. We often look at multiple actions someone has taken and see if they are mostly good actions or bad actions,\" says Mari Kawakatsu, a postdoctoral researcher in Plotkin\\'s lab.\\n\\nThrough mathematical modeling, the research team showed that looking at multiple actions and forgiving some bad actions is a method of judging behavior that is sufficient to sustain cooperation, a method they call \"look twice, forgive once.\" Their findings are published in Nature.\\n\\nThis builds on previous work Plotkin led about indirect reciprocity. For example, he worked with Kawakatsu and postdoctoral researcher Taylor A. Kessinger on a paper calculating how much gossip is necessary to reach sufficient consensus to sustain cooperation.\\n\\nPlotkin says of the new paper, \"Even if different people in a society subscribe to different norms of judgment, \\'look twice, forgive once\\' still generates sufficient consensus to promote cooperation.\" He adds that this method maintains cooperation without gossip or public institutions, which confirms the original hypothesis that Michel-Mata, first author on the paper, had that public institutions are not a prerequisite for reputation-based cooperation. It also offers an important alternative when public institutions exist but erosion of trust in institutions inhibits cooperation.\\n\\nKessinger says that, as in the paper about gossip, the game-theoretical model here is a one-shot donation game, also known as a simplified prisoner\\'s dilemma. Each player can choose to help or not help their partner, and players will periodically update their views of each other\\'s reputations by observing each other\\'s interactions with other players, to see if the partner cooperates or \"defects\" with others. More periodically, players update their strategies.\\n\\nThe idea of indirect reciprocity is \"not that I\\'m nice to Mari because she was nice to me; it\\'s that I\\'m nice to Mari because she was nice to Josh, and I have a good opinion of Josh,\" Kessinger says. In this study, \"the basic idea is that if you observed two interactions of somebody and at least one of them was an action that you would consider good, then you cooperate with that player, but otherwise you defect with them.\"\\n\\nKawakatsu says all co-authors were surprised that the \"look twice, forgive once\" strategy couldn\\'t be displaced by other strategies, such as always cooperating or always defecting, looking at more than two actions from another player, or forgiving a different proportion of \"bad actions.\" Tarnita says that, perhaps most surprisingly, looking more than twice didn\\'t yield an additional benefit. \"Information turned out to be a double-edged sword, so that even, when information was freely accessible, individuals did not typically evolve to use all of it,\" she says.\\n\\nMichel-Mata notes that the overall simplicity and robustness of their findings indicate that this behavioral strategy might be old in human societies. The authors see potential for anthropologists and behavioral scientists to build on their work.\\n\\nThe Plotkin and Tarnita labs are continuing to collaborate by exploring how people interact in more than one context, such as at work and in their personal lives. \"This touches on a range of contemporary social problems,\" Kessinger says, \"where private misbehavior becomes a matter of public record.\"', 'image': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png', 'sentiment': 0.1058823529411765, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338877693', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:00:45Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-26T23:59:10Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/best-forwards-ea-fc-25-230000632.html', 'title': 'Best forwards in EA FC 25', 'body': \"How often has the full-time whistle blown in your EA FC match only for you to glance at a scoreboard which reads 7-6 or 8-4?\\n\\nHigh-scoring thrill rides are all too frequent in EA FC - especially online - and that's largely down to the vast array of attacking talent available.

The Poland international continues to fire home frequently for Barcelona and his 88 rating in EA FC 25 is justified following another impressive scoring season in 2023/24.\\n\\nPace (75) is an issue when it comes to online play but if Lewandowski picks the ball up within 35 yards of the opposition goal, he remains a concerning threat with 88 shooting.\\n\\nSimilarly to Lewandowski, former Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg is a little on the slow side within the adrenaline-fuelled arena of Ultimate Team, but with women's football coming to Career Mode, the Norway striker will be a popular choice for managers.\\n\\nThe Lyon striker was prolific again last season as the French side reached the Champions League final and her 89 shooting reflects her ability to consistently find the back of the net with relative ease.\\n\\nHegerberg and Portland Thorns striker Sophia Smith may both be 89-rated, but they're vastly different centre-forwards in EA FC 25. Pace (93) is certainly not an issue for the United States star, whose 86 shooting, 89 dribbling and 84 physical makes her game-breaking.\\n\\nAlso capable of playing on the right wing, Smith is ideal as an advanced forward in this year's game, and you'll score plenty by launching lofted through balls over the opposition defence in her general direction.\\n\\nLautaro Martinez's stellar 2023/24 season which saw him win Serie A and the Copa America - scooping the top scorer award in both competitions - sees the Argentine handed an upgrade in this year's game. He's now 89-rated off the back of a relentless year in front of goal.\\n\\nThe Inter striker is an all-rounder in the final third on EA FC 25, with average pace beefed up by exceptional shooting and great dribbling. Four-star weak foot and skill moves are an added bonus.\\n\\nAn anterior cruciate ligament tear ruined Sam Kerr's 2023/24 campaign but she still claimed the Women's Super League title with Chelsea. However, despite missing out on the Summer Olympics in Paris, her 90 overall rating remains untouched in this year's game.\\n\\nThe Australian forward's stats are unchanged apart from a downgrade on her physical, with her powerful play style making her a handful in EA FC 25.\\n\\nHarry Kane took no time adjusting to new surroundings following a move to Bayern Munich in 2023 and the England skipper finished his debut season with the club by scoring an astonishing 44 goals in just 45 matches. The fact that he somehow ended up without his first trophy yet again beggars belief.\\n\\nHowever, his bad luck has not impacted his EA FC rating, with the 90-rated striker still one of the most lethal in the game. While his 65 pace could prove prohibitive, his game-high 93 shooting makes up for it.\\n\\nWhile classified as a LW on EA FC 25, Vinicius Junior can also feature up front in-game. The Brazil and Real Madrid superstar exhibited his ability to lead the line in 2023/24, doing so regularly en route to Champions League and La Liga glory in a 4-3-1-2 set-up.\\n\\nThe forward's astonishing 95 pace makes him a tempting proposition up top, even if he's better-suited to playing out wide. He's seen his shooting, passing and dribbling all upgraded this year.\\n\\nFootball's most devastating finisher at present, Erling Haaland was unable to replicate his freakish debut season numbers in 2023/24. He made a pretty good fist of it, however, netting 38 times in 45 appearances as injuries impacted his total tally.\\n\\nThe Norwegian sharpshooter still won the Premier League and the competition's Golden Boot, with his speed, power and finishing ability transferring nicely to EA FC.\\n\\nMatching Haaland's 91 overall rating is Real Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe. Finally donning the Spanish side's fabled white jersey, the French forward has made a quick start to life in the capital following his move from Paris Saint-Germain over the summer.\\n\\nDestined to achieve great things at the Santiago Bernabeu, Mbappe will prove an incredibly expensive acquisition on EA FC. There will be no free transfers here, but just imagine partnering him with Vinicius Junior up top.\", 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SFuM5rQNxGb0DvHfj3jBLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/90min_articles_646/02a907803e1eb7f1fdeced5e0b20a70e', 'sentiment': 0.2549019607843137, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878188', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:00:48Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-26T23:59:55Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.772549033164978, 'url': 'https://www.si.com/nfl/cowboys/news/dallas-cowboys-new-york-giants-week-4-inactives', 'title': 'Dallas Cowboys at New York Giants, Week 4 inactives', 'body': \"Kickoff between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants on Thursday Night Football is right around the corner as Week 4 of the 2024 NFL regular season gets underway in primetime.\\n\\nDallas is desperate for a win after dropping two straight at home, so they will look to continue their trend of owning the Giants going.\\n\\nUnfortunately, they will have to do so with a depleted secondary.\\n\\nAhead of Thursday night's kickoff, the inactives were announced with starting cornerback Caelen Carson inactive for the game with a shoulder injury.\\n\\nA full look at the Cowboys vs. Giants inactives can be seen below.\\n\\nKickoff between the Cowboys and Giants at MetLife Stadium is set for 8:15 p.m. ET on Prime Video.\\n\\n-- Enjoy free coverage of the Cowboys from Dallas Cowboys on SI --\\n\\nNFL Power Rankings after Week 3: How far did the Cowboys fall?\\n\\nCowboys vs. Giants, NFL Week 4: betting odds & preview\\n\\nCowboys vs. Giants: 3 keys to a Thursday night primetime victory\\n\\n3 Dallas Cowboys to start in fantasy football vs. Giants\\n\\nCowboys at Giants Week 4 injury report: 2 DBs are doubtful\", 'image': 'https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2651,h_1491,x_2294,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cowboys_country/01j8r934g0a7wvw1d31r.jpg', 'sentiment': -0.0117647058823529, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878455', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:00:49Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T00:00:27Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.4588235318660736, 'url': 'https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/9/26/24255240/kevin-lee-doesnt-understand-why-ufc-passed-on-contender-series-offer-i-think-it-wouldve-been-big', 'title': \"Kevin Lee doesn't understand why UFC passed on Contender Series offer: 'I think it would've been big'\", 'body': 'Kevin Lee is willing to take the road less traveled to get back into the UFC, or a major MMA promotion -- which included offering to compete on Dana White\\'s Contender Series.\\n\\nAs Lee said in a past interview with Anik & Florian, the UFC denied his request, and now, the one-time interim UFC lightweight title challenger has two fights on the books. First up, his MMA return this Saturday when he faces Thiago Oliveira at Lights Out Championship 17 in his home state of Michigan. The bout marks Lee\\'s first fight since a 55-second stoppage loss to Rinat Fakhretdinov at UFC Vegas 76 in July 2023.\\n\\nWhen asked why the Contender Series thought didn\\'t come to fruition, Lee still seemed a bit surprised.\\n\\n\"I think it [made] sense,\" Lee told MMA Fighting. \"I don\\'t know exactly what the problem is. I honestly don\\'t know. It\\'s not the numbers, right? I\\'ve heard Dana kind of brag about Belal Muhammad when he wrapped the belt around him and he bragged that he got more views than any other champion -- and it was like 20 million views or something. But my brother [former fighter-turned-famous food vlogger Keith Lee] did a small video for me getting ready for my last fight in the APEX and, keep this in mind, this is a prelim APEX card fight, and my brother did a post and he got 12 million views compared to a champion that did 20 million views and Dana\\'s bragging about it, so I don\\'t think that\\'s the issue.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think the issue is me not willing to show up and put on great fights because that\\'s all I\\'ve ever done. Honestly I can\\'t point to what the issue is. I don\\'t know. I offered to do that fight. I think it would have been big. I think it would have been great for Dana White\\'s Contender Series, but the offer is off the table at this point. I offered it. They said no, we\\'ll move on. No sweat off my brow.\"\\n\\nLee now heads back to the regional MMA scene to face Oliveira, and less than two months later, the 32-year-old debuts for Jorge Masvidal\\'s Gamebred Bareknuckle MMA promotion in Biloxi, Miss., at their eighth event, where he fights Saul Almeida.\\n\\nFor \"The Motown Phenom,\" the booking with Almeida happened quickly, and he couldn\\'t say yes fast enough.\\n\\n\"Anybody who is a professional fighter knows having that date really sets the training in motion,\" Lee explained. \"It really kind of gives you a sense of purpose almost. I\\'ve been fighting for a long, long time, so it\\'s not like I\\'m hung up on fighting for the UFC. That\\'s where I built my career and I feel like I\\'ve given a lot to the company, but if that\\'s not what\\'s next, then that\\'s not what\\'s next. I\\'ll fight somewhere else.\\n\\n\"And that\\'s what I\\'m going to do and maybe it is a part of it that I got to show my worth to them still. It\\'s a little crazy to say that at this point in my career given how much I\\'ve actually done for the company. But I think I\\'m very opinionated, and I think that may have rubbed Dana the wrong [way] a few times. I made some comments about the APEX, and I guess that may be [something that bothered him]. But listen, this is what I do. This is part of being me. If people ask me a question, I give them a true and honest answer. And at the same time, I\\'ve never done anybody wrong in this industry -- from media guys, to publicists, the PR, everybody in the backstage of the UFC, I feel like everybody I\\'ve touched, I\\'ve done right. So at the end of the day I hold my head up, we fight this next fight on Saturday.\"\\n\\nThe journey back to where Lee feels he belongs in the current pantheon of the sport begins this weekend. On paper, Lee would certainly be a heavy favorite against the 30-fight pro in Oliveira, but that doesn\\'t mean there\\'s a lot of weight on his shoulders in regards to where the result may take him.\\n\\n\"A little more relaxed, but at the same time, there\\'s still a ton of pressure when I go back home and I\\'m not a world champion,\" Lee said. \"Yeah, sure, I fought for a belt, but I\\'m not a world champion. So I feel like I still have a lot left to prove, and yeah there\\'s a ton of pressure. With experience comes a little bit more relaxation. With experience comes like, \\'OK, I just know how these feelings go, and I know how to control them.\\' But there\\'s a ton of pressure and I\\'m definitely feeling it for this fight.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to whoop his ass. I\\'m going to show there\\'s levels to the fight game, and at the end of the day, I\\'m going to show that I\\'m back and I\\'m healthy, and I\\'m ready to compete at 155 pounds. I know this fight is at 170, but that\\'s because of the short notice.

Since then, Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in back-and-forth air attacks, killing combatants and civilians, destroying homes and setting farmland on fire.\\n\\nOver the past week, the Israeli military has greatly expanded its attacks on Hezbollah by launching a major bombing campaign, with the declared aim of returning some 60,000 displaced residents of northern Israel to their homes.\\n\\nThe airstrikes, the most significant by Israel since its 2006 war with Hezbollah, have killed senior commanders in the group and blown up its weapons stores.

His goal for \"Vindicating Trump\" is to present a different view of Trump\\'s character and presidency -- a perspective he hopes more Americans will come to appreciate.\\n\\n\"I think Trump is aware that he represents something bigger than himself. He is conscious of that,\" D\\'Souza said. \"I think he feels that his destiny is, in a sense, incomplete, and that\\'s part of what\\'s driving him.\"\\n\\nRead an abridged and lightly edited transcript of our conversation below or watch the full interview above.\\n\\nRob Bluey: You have called this your most urgent and important piece of work. Now, that\\'s saying quite a lot, given the extensive body of filmmaking that you\\'ve done. Why?\\n\\nDinesh D\\'Souza: It\\'s partly a reflection of the precarious state of the country. It\\'s partly because we have this larger-than-life figure, Trump, and not only is he someone that inspires this kind of antagonism on the other side, but he also brings out ambivalence among some conservatives and Republicans. And so often people say to me things like, \"Well, I don\\'t really like the guy, but I like his policies,\" or, \"He needs to keep his mouth shut.\"\\n\\nWhat they\\'re really getting at is they want a new and different Trump. They want to remake Trump in some way. Now, first of all, leaving aside the impracticality of trying to do that, I don\\'t think we need to do it. And the reason is that Trump is a package, and he\\'s a kind of a coherent package. And it\\'s kind of like saying, in the Civil War, the same qualities that made General Grant a good fighter on the battlefield made him cuss a lot and made him a heavy drinker. So you can\\'t say, \"Pull him off the battlefield. He cusses. He\\'s a heavy drinker,\" because that\\'s part of what makes him effective.\\n\\nSimilarly with Trump, even the things that we think of as his bad qualities, like his massive egotism, which he admits to, in fact, he\\'s one of the few people I\\'ve ever seen who\\'s made an actual defense of egotism. Egotism is really necessary to do anything great. He goes, \"If you don\\'t have an ego, you\\'re going to be discouraged and give up halfway down the track.\"\\n\\nTrump is a unique character. I wanted to bring out aspects of Trump in this film that are not often seen in the public stage, and the reason they\\'re not seen is Trump is conditioned out of kind of manly strength to not exhibit feelings, never show vulnerability, and in some ways not even reveal his thought process. So I was eager to set him up in such a way that people could see the tumblers of his mind working and understand how he processes information.\\n\\nRob Bluey: One of the things that struck me was the beginning. You show a series of clips, a montage, beginning with Jay Leno and other appearances that Trump made prior to entering politics, so going back to his time as a New York businessman, a celebrity, a host of \"The Apprentice,\" things of that nature. But you say that there was that fateful moment when he crossed the political Rubicon, I believe was your language, in June of 2015, descending from those escalator steps at Trump Tower. What was it about that moment that changed in people\\'s minds about Trump?\\n\\nDinesh D\\'Souza: Let\\'s think of that iconic moment. Of course, it\\'s in the film, but most people know it. Trump is at the top of the escalator, and imagine that up there is the cultural elite. Trump, himself, is probably the biggest brand of them all, but there he is with Oprah and Ellen DeGeneres and Charlie Rose and Larry King, and he\\'s one of them, and the rappers aspire to be like him. So he\\'s almost the embodiment of American success, Trump. And then he does something very striking, and that is he descends, he goes down. Now where does he go down to?\\n\\nTry to imagine at the bottom of the escalator the forgotten American, so not the guy who\\'s doing real well, but the guy who feels like the economy\\'s bypassed me, my jobs have all gone abroad, no one cares about me, neither party\\'s paying enough attention to me. Trump basically says, \"OK, I\\'m going to take up your cause. I\\'m going to join your team.\"\\n\\nSo you can understand, just in this little image, the fact that all these people go, \"Wow!\" Well, you know what? He didn\\'t have to do that. He\\'s a billionaire. He\\'s actually not one of us, but he\\'s taking up our cause, so that\\'s why they\\'re so loyal to him. At the same time, think of it now from the point of view of the cultural elite. This guy used to be on our team. He\\'s now joined with the pitchfork people down there, he\\'s taking up their cause against us. So here we see in a nutshell how the same people that once revered him turned against him. They see him as a traitor to their class, a traitor to their group, and they\\'ll never forgive him.\\n\\nRob Bluey: And your film goes from that moment where Trump is descending, and then you depict what it\\'s like to be a news executive. And their reactions, you show what the scene may have been like at the Democratic National Committee, what it might\\'ve been like at the attorney general\\'s office. So why was it important for you to reenact these moments, going back to 2015 and other moments throughout Trump\\'s time in the spotlight?\\n\\nDinesh D\\'Souza: We have reenactments running through the film, and they\\'re a distinctive aspect of my filmmaking, because there is a documentary style that is, I would call it super basic. And that is, you do some interviews, you pull some stock footage, you string it together and you\\'ve got a film, but you can\\'t put that kind of film in the theater.\\n\\nA movie is an experience, and a good documentary film will have a lot of the elements of a feature film. It will have characters, humor, suspense, kind of a narrative arc, a climax, all of that. And now, so I said to myself, what is the thing that many of us know is happening but we never see? We never see what actually happens in the intelligence agencies. We never see what happens, for example, at the New York Times or CNN.\\n\\nImagine the scene where they\\'re announcing that Trump is convicted of multiple felonies, right? Do the reporters of the New York Times watch this with a kind of equanimity and go, \"That\\'s an important news story I\\'ve got to cover tomorrow,\" or are they high-fiving each other, \"We got him! We got him! Maggie Haberman, great job!\" So what we do is we imaginatively recreate these Democratic National Committee, the sort of voter activism, the media, the intelligence agencies. Nick Searcy, who\\'s a very accomplished character actor, plays kind of the head of the intelligence apparatus. And all of this allows people to see the story of Trump told within the context of a movie.\\n\\nIt\\'s also the kind of thing, by the way, that Trump himself appreciates, because I remember at the premiere for 2000 Mules at Mar-a-Lago, he had seen the film before. So he actually knew the content of the film, he had sort of digested that. But the second time he saw it, he was constantly commenting on the film itself, like, \"The music, Dinesh, where do you get music from? Do you buy music? Do you have a guy who composes the music?\"\\n\\nAnd he\\'d be like, \"Your voice, Dinesh,\" he\\'s like, \"you have a movie voice. Did anyone ever tell you that? You have a movie voice, and it\\'s a good thing you have a movie voice, because if you didn\\'t have a movie voice, you\\'d have to hire someone else to narrate your films,\" so stuff that makes me chuckle, but I realize, wow, this guy is a cultural figure and he\\'s interested in the way that cultural products and artifacts, like movies, are made.\\n\\nRob Bluey: That\\'s very true. And I think one of the things that you\\'ve obviously experienced in your interactions with him is getting to know him and who he is as a person, and you attempt to bring that out in the film. I do like that unique style that you do bring to your documentaries. I think it sets you apart and you\\'ve proven that in your body of work.\\n\\nIn addition to interviewing Trump for this film, you also spoke to his daughter-in-law and one of his attorneys. What can you tell us about Donald Trump that we might not know after all of these years, and including the last decade, basically, in the public spotlight?\\n\\nDinesh D\\'Souza: I\\'ll tell you an anecdote that is true and was sort of the inspiration for the way I interviewed Trump. And in fact, my wife, Debbie, warned me. She\\'s like, \"You have 45 minutes with Trump, Dinesh, but you realize you\\'re going to get two questions in, right, because this guy\\'s going to take off and he\\'s just going to do a monologue.\" And I said, \"No, I can\\'t have that happen. I\\'m not going to allow that to happen. I have to structure it in such a way that it doesn\\'t happen like that.\"\\n\\nAnd why? Well, when I got my presidential pardon, this was obviously after my campaign finance troubles with the Obama administration, I met Trump for the first time. I didn\\'t know Trump. I\\'m not like a long-time, early Trumpster or anything like that, 2019, in the Oval Office. And Debbie, my wife, said to Trump, she goes, \"I don\\'t understand you. You get flayed on every platform, every moment of every day. A normal person couldn\\'t take that. Does it get to you?\"\\n\\nNow, quite honestly, Debbie and I both expected Trump to go, \"Ha ha ha. No, it doesn\\'t get to me. These people are idiots, they\\'re crazy. I enjoy it,\" that kind of thing. But he paused and he goes, \"Well, guys, I have to admit that there are times it really gets to me.\" He, goes, \"I\\'m doing this for the country.\" He goes, \"I got al-Baghdadi,\" and he goes, \"and even on that, they won\\'t give me any credit for that.\"\\n\\nWe sensed a vulnerability in Trump, and as we left, we said to ourselves, and my wife said, she said, \"It\\'s a pity that Trump doesn\\'t put that aspect of himself on display for the American people to see,\" but I think Trump is such a man\\'s man that he doesn\\'t like to do that. Even when Dr. Phil interviewed him, Dr. Phil tried, as a psychologist, you know, \"The assassination, how did it make you feel?\" Well, Trump hates that kind of question and absolutely refused to go there.\\n\\nBut I wanted to bring out some aspects of Trump\\'s personality, the kind of normalcy of the man, which the press, I think, willfully misunderstands. Trump is a bit of a jokester. So, when he says, \"I\\'m going to be a dictator for a day,\" I mean, who can actually take that seriously, being a dictator, and yet it\\'s used as exhibit A in the evidence that he really will be a dictator and will never leave.\\n\\nI put those sorts of questions to Trump. I go, \"You troll people with these memes, Trump \\'28, Trump \\'32, Trump \\'36,\" I go, \"Well, are you going to leave? Are you going to be like the guy in the Western who takes care of the gangsters and then rides off into the sunset, or are you planning to kind of stay?\" And having Trump respond to these things, I think, will be very interesting and engaging for the audience.\\n\\nRob Bluey: I agree. You saw some of this on display at the Republican National Convention when there was a big effort to introduce his extended family, the grandkids, to the American people, but you said that Trump being a man\\'s man doesn\\'t necessarily gravitate toward that approach.\\n\\nDo you think that that might benefit him, though, with some of those voters who remain skeptical about him as a person?\\n\\nDinesh D\\'Souza: I was trying to think to myself who has been a figure, that I can think of, that on the one hand has people who are so loyal to him they would take a bullet for him, and on the other hand, have people who at least secretly wish that somebody else would put a bullet in him, right? That\\'s not a normal situation. You wouldn\\'t say that that would be true of Reagan, even of Jimmy Carter.\\n\\nYou have to go all the way back to Abraham Lincoln to find that kind of divide. Now, the difference between Lincoln and Trump is that in Lincoln\\'s case, the divide was not over him, it was not over the man. It was over the issue, it was over slavery, it was over the divide in the country, over that. With Trump, it is over the man, and therefore, in this movie, I realized we need to bring out Trump the man. I cannot duck that issue. This is not just about policy.\\n\\nEven Republicans who are reluctant about Trump, their hesitation is based on Trump the man, and on a kind of, I think, very one-sided and limited perception of his character. So let\\'s talk about that for a moment, because I\\'ll hear people say things like, \"Well, he\\'s a playboy.\" And I say to myself, well, he was a playboy in his younger days, I think he actually admits this, but no one\\'s saying he\\'s a playboy now. So the most you can say about him, the worst, he\\'s a reformed playboy. Okay, what else? \"He\\'s an egomaniac.\" Also true.\\n\\nTrump loves praise, he loves public praise. Interestingly, in private, he\\'s more self-deprecating. If you saw him on Gutfeld recently, you see this kind of whimsical Trump. He\\'s not somebody who you have to keep kissing his feet and flattering the dauphin or the prince in a courtier style, not at all, not in person, but he does like public praise.\\n\\nBut in a way, I think with Trump, his egotism is a sort of protection. It\\'s a wall. It insulates him because, again, a normal person would be just destroyed by the kind of attack that Trump gets. And then Trump\\'s virtues, he\\'s magnanimous.\\n\\nEven though a lot of billionaires kind of secede from the middle class, Trump doesn\\'t do that. There\\'s an ordinariness to him. He has a curiosity about people. You\\'ll never get someone who\\'s a doorman or someone who works as a waiter in one of his hotels ever say a bad word about him. He\\'s very nice to them. He knows their family, he asks about how their kids are doing, he\\'s that kind of a guy. He\\'s obviously very kind and good to his family, they adore him.\\n\\nBut above all, one virtue that he has, that I want to stress, is his supreme virtue of courage, because that is a rare virtue. Aristotle says it\\'s the highest virtue, and it\\'s in fact the virtue that makes all the other virtues possible, because courage gives you the strength to do all the other virtues, so it\\'s an active virtue. Trump has it in spades. I think it is a virtue somewhat lacking, by and large, in the Republican party, particularly when we\\'re facing people who want to take away our basic liberties.\\n\\nIt\\'s almost like we need a tough guy on our side to take on the tough-guy regime that has been mobilized against us. Trump\\'s willing to do it, and for this reason, I think that in this hour of our country\\'s history, he is not only the best man, in some ways he\\'s the perfect guy.\\n\\nRob Bluey: I\\'m so glad you brought up the point about courage, because it is lacking among so many in the political class, I\\'d say on both sides of the aisle, not just exclusively Republicans, but maybe that\\'s where we tend to see it more often on display. And I think that probably makes some of those Republican lawmakers uncomfortable, because of the things that Trump wants to do.\\n\\nI\\'m glad you brought up Lincoln. You have a reenactment of Lincoln in the film. You also referenced Lincoln in your interview with Trump. Does he recognize his place in history, and did he react at all to that comparison?\\n\\nDinesh D\\'Souza: Yeah, he does. I think he recognizes that, and this is rare for someone who has served one term, there have been a few, well, I can think of a couple of consequential one-term presidents. So, Polk, Democrat, was a president who almost single-handedly doubled the size of the country in the middle of the 19th century. Turned out it was a very consequential presidency, and so that was the case.\\n\\nI think Trump is aware that he represents something bigger than himself. He is conscious of that. He\\'s not the kind of person who does historical analogies, comparisons, but what he likes is he likes an acknowledgment of his role on the larger, historical stage. I think he feels that his destiny is, in a sense, incomplete, and that\\'s part of what\\'s driving him.\\n\\nBecause think of it, if you and I were billionaires, we had eight, 10 years to live, we have grandchildren, we have Mar-a-Lago, and on the other side, we\\'re facing a shotgun of 91 criminal charges, two assassination attempts, with potentially more to come, no normal person would go for that. You\\'d be like, I\\'m out of here, I don\\'t need any of this, so something must be pushing this man forward, and I think, in that sense, it\\'s love of country and it\\'s a sense of destiny.\\n\\nRob Bluey: You talk about how he was coasting to reelection in 2020 when COVID hit. Did you sense from him that there\\'s unfinished business that he would like to accomplish in a second term that he was not able to do as a result of what was essentially foisted upon him by China in the spring of 2020?\\n\\nDinesh D\\'Souza: Trump has done a lot to expose, to peel the layers off the onion, to expose the corruption in the institutions of government that we didn\\'t know to be looking for it over there. So in fact, these are institutions that have traditionally been considered conservative.\\n\\nWe all know that the media is left-wing, Hollywood\\'s left-wing, academia is left-wing, but I never thought the FBI was left-wing, and I never thought the CIA was left-wing, the military is left-wing, no. But nevertheless, starting, I think, in the Obama years, there was a conscious effort to remake those institutions, certainly at the top, but it affects the bottom because the people at the top recreate an incentive structure that filters all the way down.\\n\\nI think with Trump, when he came in, he thought he could trust the military. That\\'s why he brought in John Kelly as a general. I\\'ll bring in a general. Generals are straight shooters. He\\'ll give it to me straight. I think Trump also thought he could trust the people in the white lab coats. I mean, we all do, right?\\n\\nYou go to the doctor, \"I\\'m going to take your appendix out. Come in next week.\" You never go, \"Well, prove it to me that my appendix is defective. Show me some pictures so I can just make up,\" no. You\\'re like, \"Well, I agree. Yeah, I\\'ll take these tests. Yeah, you can go ahead and do this.\"\\n\\nThis implicit trust in the health authorities, I don\\'t think any of us really dreamed that that could be ideologically manipulated, but now we know that it blatantly was. I think Trump knows also, and I think Trump realizes that, in the second term, he\\'s got to realize that the serpents are more numerous and their dens are deeper than we had previously suspected.\\n\\nRob Bluey: I suspect that you\\'ll see a much-heightened focus on the people who get those political jobs, whom he entrusts to carry out his agenda, based on his experiences. We\\'re talking to Dinesh D\\'Souza, who has a new film out this Friday called Vindicating Trump.\\n\\nDinesh, you talked earlier about how in our country you have an alarming number of opponents of Trump. A recent poll put it at 28% of Democrats said the country would be better off if Trump had been assassinated after the second attempt. On the other side, you have many MAGA Republicans or other conservatives who believe he\\'s the only hope that we have to save our constitutional republic.\\n\\nHow can we live in a country where people hold such diametrically opposing views?\\n\\nDinesh D\\'Souza: I think the problem is serious, but it is not quite as bad as we think for this reason. The people on the Trump side, on the Republican side, are making a balanced judgment about Trump because they\\'re exposed to Trump, they\\'re exposed to the defenses of Trump, and they\\'re also exposed to the criticism of Trump, because none of us can avoid the mainstream media in our lives.\\n\\nWe see it. We know about it. But now look at the other side, and I\\'m talking here about the rank-and-file Democrat. The rank-and-file Democrat does not actually know a lot about Trump. They do not get the pro-Trump side at all. They get a nonstop propagandistic diet of anti-Trump polemic. If CNN has a panel of 17 people, they\\'re all anti-Trump. There may be two or three Republicans, but they\\'re selected because they\\'re anti-Trump.\\n\\nSo as a result, one is forgiven, because think about it, when you\\'re an intelligent person, how do discover a fact, right? You discover a fact when you see that fact appear in multiple sources, sources that you admittedly cannot check for yourself, but you think to yourself, well, if I see it in Barnes and Noble in a book, and then there it is on PBS, there it is on the history channel, there it is and Michael Moore made a film about it, Rachel Maddow\\'s talking about it, and here it is in the New York Times, well, it must be true, because why would all these independent people have made this up, the same thing?\\n\\nThey don\\'t realize that it\\'s actually more like the same bullet ricocheting off multiple walls and coming at you from different directions. You think that you\\'re getting independent sources of information, not realizing that all these people, not that they are conspiring together, but they\\'re more like birds in a flying formation going to Florida, all flying side by side in the same pattern.\\n\\nSo that\\'s what I\\'m getting at, is I think that a film like this would be very startling for an independent or a Democrat because most of what they see about it. And the nice thing about a film is a book and an argument is about something. I\\'m going to tell you, let\\'s say for example, about my life in India, but it won\\'t give you a good idea of what that\\'s like.\\n\\nNow imagine I show you a video. I say, \"That\\'s me as a kid, and that was my room, and that\\'s the vendor outside my door selling bananas, and there\\'s the guy with the monkey, and he\\'s doing tricks on the street,\" you\\'d be like, oh, wow, I get a real feeling of what it would\\'ve been like to grow up in India, let\\'s say in the 1970s, and that\\'s what a movie can do.\\n\\nSo the movie is like you\\'ve heard all this stuff about Trump, now here\\'s Trump. And we\\'re going to talk, and you\\'re going to listen, and you\\'re going to see stuff that runs so counter to everything you\\'ve heard about Trump that you almost want to spit up your popcorn.\\n\\nI\\'m thinking of ways to try to bring people who are independents, and of course for people watching, if you can go watch the movie, by the way, the website is vindicatingtrump.com. You can put your city in, it\\'ll pull up all the theaters. There\\'s also a book of the same title you can pre-order. But my point is, if you can bring along that grumbling, anti-Trump relative or that buddy of yours, you\\'re like, \"Hey, I\\'ll buy your ticket,\" I think it will have a tremendous effect.\\n\\nRob Bluey: Getting the Democrats and independents to go see your movie, I think not only might change their perspective, because they haven\\'t been exposed to that Donald Trump that you feature in the film, but up until now, maybe they just don\\'t have any desire to. You\\'ve given them a relatively easy way, through the 90-minute film, to get a sense of who the man really is.\\n\\nDinesh D\\'Souza: A film appeals to the head and the heart, and that\\'s part of the power of a film, because I often will hear conservatives say something to the effect of, \"Well, the liberals do not think in a cognitively rational way, they appeal to emotion. There\\'s no question that with Kamala Harris they\\'re doing that. They\\'re basically saying, \"Don\\'t trust your lying eyes.\"\\n\\nThey\\'re telling the American people, \"Don\\'t trust your pocketbook, don\\'t trust the prices you pay in the grocery store, don\\'t trust your retirement account, don\\'t even trust what you\\'ve seen and heard about Kamala Harris, because that\\'s made you dislike her. We have a new, manufactured Kamala Harris for you right here. You should believe in our mythology about Kamala Harris.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s really based upon the presumption that the ordinary guy is a real buffoon, but it\\'s also based on the idea that the ordinary guy reacts only emotionally and not rationally. Well, the nice thing about a film is that a film operates primarily on the emotional medium, for sure.\\n\\nThat\\'s why films have a score. If you want to know what that music is doing under the film, it is regulating your emotions as you watch the film.\\n\\nThe good news is that if you do a good job with the emotional narrative, you can pack a lot of genuine, thoughtful information in a film, but if you make the mistake of making a film that has lots of thoughtful information but doesn\\'t have the emotional component, the film will not succeed.\\n\\nRob Bluey: Let\\'s talk about your interview with Trump. I would imagine something like this is scheduled in advance. You had no way of knowing that you were going to sit down with him one week after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. What was it like talking to him so close to that experience? Did you notice any changes from your previous interactions with him?\\n\\nDinesh D\\'Souza: I did. I noticed that Trump was somewhat more measured. He seemed somewhat more reflective in the sense of now seeing his own life as maybe having some sort of a directed purpose.\\n\\nHe\\'s reluctant, and to be honest, even Reagan was. Reagan would say things like, \"Well, the man upstairs,\" that was his reference to God. \"The man upstairs may not like that,\" things like that. And Trump, too, talks about providence in a roundabout way, but I do ask him those things, because I mean, it\\'s not just that Lincoln, for example, had, in the second inaugural, this very powerful providential sense that you don\\'t get in the early Lincoln, but it\\'s that Washington and Lincoln believed that the country is part of a providential narrative.\\n\\nAnd so I posed this question directly to Trump, and I think I posed it to him at the right time. If I posed it to him at another time, he might\\'ve looked at me with a funny look like, why are you asking me that, what kind of a question is that?\\n\\nTrump normally is not in the contemplative mode. He\\'s a doer. I mean, think of it, this is a guy who\\'s built a big part of the New York skyline. Trump thinks operationally, like how do we get this done? Trump was at his golf course, the Doral in Miami, the thing about Trump is when he walks into the, he looks and he\\'s like, \"We need to take that palm tree down. That\\'s an obstruction to the golf course over there. I want people to be able to see people playing on the course.\" And so he\\'s constantly thinking of how do I make this property better, more attractive, and that\\'s very different than, for example, an academic way of thinking.\\n\\nAnd Charlie Rose interviewed Trump when he was facing a downturn. And Charlie Rose asked him, he goes, \"You\\'ve come out of this, and it was a real doldrums, and not only were you bankrupt, you owed a large amount of money. Did you ever have any doubts?\" Trump goes, \"No.\" He goes, \"Never?\" Trump goes, \"No.\"\\n\\nNow, see, to an academic, that is not only abnormal, that is objectionable, because the academic thinks, well, that just shows a total lack of introspection, that just shows a man who has no self-consciousness, aren\\'t you even aware of your situation? But for Trump, if he was that way, it would shut him down.\\n\\nI think the same with the criminal trials, because I asked Trump about the criminal trials. I go, \"Any other guy facing three criminal charges would be, first of all, emotionally undone, but probably would\\'ve exited the race. And you not only don\\'t exit it, but you\\'re out there the day of your hearings and you\\'re under a gag order, but you\\'re having a press conference, you\\'re lambasting the judge. You\\'re doing your legal rope-a-dope.\"\\n\\nAnd Trump goes, and I think this struck me, he goes, \"I will just not allow myself to be bothered by it.\" So think about the level of self-control it takes to do that. I will not allow myself to be bothered by the fact that I\\'m facing multiple criminal charges that could put me in prison for life.', 'image': 'https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/240926_DineshDSouza.jpg', 'sentiment': -0.02745098039215688, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878477', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:00:54Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T00:00:32Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.newsday.co.zw/news/article/76967/corruption-roadblocks-major-threats-to-tourism', 'title': \"'Corruption, roadblocks major threats to tourism'\", 'body': 'STAKEHOLDERS in the tourism industry have cited corruption, police\\'s innumerable roadblocks, lack of a travelling culture by locals and the public\\'s negative perception towards local products as major factors affecting efforts to rebrand Zimbabwe as a safe tourist destination.\\n\\nSTAKEHOLDERS in the tourism industry have cited corruption, police\\'s innumerable roadblocks, lack of a travelling culture by locals and the public\\'s negative perception towards local products as major factors affecting efforts to rebrand Zimbabwe as a safe tourist destination.\\n\\nThis came out during a Zimbabwe Image Management workshop held in Bindura on Friday.

Koreans shut out on opening day of Presidents Cup | Yonhap News Agency', 'body': 'SEOUL, Sept. 27 (Yonhap) -- All three South Korean players in action for the International Team on the opening day of the Presidents Cup failed to pick up a point, as the heavily favored United States jumped out to a 5-0 lead in Canada.\\n\\nThe all-Korean tandem of Im Sung-jae and Tom Kim lost to Russell Henley and Scottie Scheffler 3 & 2 in the third fourball match of the day at Royal Montreal Golf Club in Montreal on Thursday (local time). In the first match of the competition, South Korean An Byeong-hun teamed up with the Australian veteran Jason Day, but Tony Finau and Xander Schauffele beat them 1 up.\\n\\nThe Presidents Cup is a biennail match-play competition between the U.S. and a team of non-European international players. This is the 15th edition of the event, and the Americans have won 12 of the 14 so far, with one tie and one loss.\\n\\nIn fourball matches, players each play their own ball and the better score of the two players ends up as their team\\'s score on each hole.\\n\\nKim, the youngest player at this year\\'s competition at 22, had said Wednesday he wanted \"a revenge match\" against Scheffler, world No. 1 and a close friend of Kim\\'s. In June, Kim lost to Scheffler in a playoff at the Travelers Championship.\\n\\nKim did his part, making four birdies and celebrating them with exaggerated fist pumps and shouts. But Im did not make any birdie, as the U.S. duo closed out the match on the 16th hole.\\n\\nThe match turned chippy on the seventh green, where Scheffler made a 27-foot birdie putt to match Kim\\'s birdie and, just before the ball found the cup, turned around in Kim\\'s direction and yelled, \"What was that?\"\\n\\nKim drained another long birdie putt on the eighth hole, and he and Im proceeded to walk to the next tee box before Scheffler stepped up to his birdie attempt. According to reports, U.S. assistant captain Kevin Kisner was bothered by the South Koreans\\' action and raised the issue with his International Team counterpart Camilo Villegas.\\n\\nHenley and Scheffler led 1 up through 13 holes, and then Henley birdied the 14th and 15th to put the match out of the South Koreans\\' reach.\\n\\nKim said afterward he was disappointed to have come up short despite playing some great golf. He also said he enjoyed trading birdies with Scheffler.\\n\\n\"He was being himself, and that\\'s how we play back at home. I knew it was going to happen, and it\\'s all fun,\" he said. \"I made it on top of him, and he gave it to me, and I gave it to him back on the next hole. I don\\'t shy away from him. He\\'s a good friend, but this week, I don\\'t like him. I want to beat him so bad, and I\\'m sure he feels the same way.\"\\n\\nOn his walk to the ninth tee after making that birdie on the eighth, Kim said he and Im \"were focusing on our own game.\"\\n\\n\"I made a putt, and whether he made it or not, it wasn\\'t going to make a difference, and there was no reason to stay there and look at him putt. That doesn\\'t help us at all,\" Kim said. \"And I wasn\\'t trying to be cheap or trying to do anything like that. I\\'m sorry that the answer is pretty boring, but literally, it was just I made a putt. Whatever happens happens.\"\\n\\nIn the day\\'s first match, Day birdied the first hole to put the Internationals ahead, before Schauffele responded with a birdie on the next hole.\\n\\nDown by two holes through 14, An\\'s birdie and Day\\'s par helped the International duo draw even.

It\\'s an integral part of the new normal.\"\\n\\nHe explained that organisations must now focus on integrating AI into their everyday operations to stay relevant. \"The pandemic has shown us that agility and adaptability are non-negotiable.

The spot had been a bar and grill since at least the 1950s.\\n\\nSiblings Gabe and Kate Mauch have been keeping Griffith wired for 12 years and Whiting wire for four years.

It\\'s known for craft drink like the Shopkeeper\\'s Daughter Cherry Mocha, Virtuoso of the Void White Chocolate Lavender, the Red Priestess Rooibos Tea Latte with Vanilla and the seasonal Cactor Frozen Pear Lemonade.\\n\\nIt offers salads and sandwiches like the Croque Grindhouse, Turkey Dolo and Blue Cheese Beef Bomb. The Highland location has the same menu as the other locations but may offer pop-up brunches or dinners with beverage pairings in the future.\\n\\n\"Consistency is one of the most important things in a restaurant from food to hours,\" he said. \"In my experience, if a restaurant says it\\'s open on Tuesday and it\\'s not open, I might try it a second time but if it\\'s not open then I\\'m never going back. I want Grindhouse to be consistent at all times. When we were first starting, people would tell me the drinks tasted so much better when I was working. It was meant as a complement but it freaked me out because I wanted to ensure they tasted the same, no matter who was making them.\"\\n\\nThe new spot has a large back room that will host events like concerts, plant swaps, board game nights and Dungeons and Dragons.

The sale is expected to provide financial flexibility, allowing the company to accelerate its focus on OLED technology.\\n\\nAccording to the filing, LG Display will hand over all of its stake in the plant to China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSOT), a subsidiary of Chinese home appliance giant TCL, on March 31, 2025.\\n\\nThe LCD plant consists of two divisions -- panels and modules -- each managed by different corporate entities. LG Display holds an 80 percent stake in the panel division, with the remaining 20 percent owned by Guangzhou Development District. LG Display also fully owns the module division.\\n\\nOriginally, LG Display held a 70 percent stake in the panel division but increased it to 80 percent earlier this month by acquiring a 10 percent stake from China\\'s Skyworth for 244 billion won, aiming to expedite the sale.\\n\\nIn the filing, LG Display said it is selling the stake to \"improve efficiency to focus on the OLED business.\" The company noted that the sale would enhance its competitiveness and stabilize its financial position, but added that it is not yet in a position to disclose plans for the 2 trillion won fund raised through the sale.\\n\\nThe sale offers LG Display a chance to rebalance its position in the large LCD market, which has become oversaturated and highly competitive due to the cost advantages of Chinese rivals.\\n\\nRead MoreLG Display seeks rebound by selling Guangzhou LCD plant\\n\\nLG Display has been actively scaling down its large LCD business in recent years due to the limited potential for differentiating its products from Chinese competitors, coupled with increasing market volatility in the large LCD sector.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Chinese manufacturers place significant value on the competitiveness of large LCD panels for TVs, which continue to dominate the display market. This put LG Display in urgent need to unload its stake in the plant to focus on more strategic areas.\\n\\nWhile reducing its involvement in large LCD businesses, LG Display has been focusing on higher value-added products, such as small- and mid-sized OLED panels for IT devices. This shift allows the company to capitalize on growing demand for premium displays in sectors like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.\\n\\nIndustry officials note that while LG Display currently holds a technological advantage over competitors in the OLED sector, Chinese rivals like BOE are rapidly closing the gap through significant investments. This raises concerns that LG Display might face a similar decline in its OLED business as it did with large LCDs, where Chinese firms gained an edge through aggressive pricing and scale.\\n\\nAlthough LG Display has not disclosed specific plans for the use of the funds from the sale, the market anticipates that the money will be directed toward advancing its OLED business and supporting its financial stability.\\n\\nMeanwhile, LG Display will retain its LCD products for IT devices and automobiles. The company plans to concentrate on high-end products, emphasizing features such as low power consumption, distinctive design, and higher resolutions.\\n\\nWith LG Display\\'s sale of the large LCD plant in Guangzhou, no South Korean company is producing large LCD panels for televisions.

(WFLA) - As Hurricane Helene churns in the Gulf of Mexico, cutting-edge technology from Saildrone, Inc. is giving us a firsthand look at the storm's incredible power. A Saildrone unmanned surface vehicle (USV), SD-1083, captured stunning video footage from inside the storm.\\n\\nOn Thursday, SD-1083 was positioned approximately 100 nautical miles north-northeast of Hurricane Helene's edge at 12:45 UTC. By 17:46 UTC, the unmanned vehicle found itself just 95 nautical miles from the hurricane's eye, experiencing massive waves and intense wind gusts. The video and data collected offer a rare glimpse of the storm's approach from the safety of an advanced drone.\\n\\nThe footage, shared courtesy of Saildrone and NOAA, shows waves reaching several meters high, while wind gusts peaked at 24.53 knots, showcasing the raw force of nature as the storm bears down. This visual documentation of the hurricane's impact is not only remarkable for its clarity but also significant in providing scientists with real-time data from inside a major storm system.\\n\\nSaildrone USVs like SD-1083 are designed to operate in the world's most extreme ocean environments. Founded in 2012 by Richard Jenkins, Saildrone has developed a fleet of unmanned ocean drones used for scientific research, ocean mapping, and environmental monitoring. Partners like NOAA, NASA, and leading research institutions around the world rely on the Saildrone fleet for data collection that was once too dangerous or inaccessible for human researchers.\\n\\nIn the case of Hurricane Helene, the footage gathered by the Saildrone will help scientists better understand the behavior of hurricanes and how they intensify. This is especially crucial as climate change continues to impact the frequency and strength of these powerful storms.\\n\\nSaildrone's unmanned vehicles have previously provided critical data for oceanic and atmospheric research, and their work in hurricane monitoring represents a breakthrough in storm prediction and safety measures.

It wasn\\'t the first game that he\\'d made an impact on offense, but in comparison to how paltry Javonte Williams and Jaleel McLaughlin\\'s rushing averages have been this season, Badie\\'s 7.8 yards-per-carry average stuck out.\\n\\nPerhaps worried that an outside team might try to pluck him off the practice squad, the Broncos officially promoted Badie to the 53-man roster this week. The move could be a harbinger of a bigger role coming for the former Baltimore Ravens sixth-round pick.\\n\\nSince Badie joined the Broncos, the team\\'s PR department has provided pronunciation of his name, phonetically spelling it out as \\'Bay-dee.\\' However, during his breakout performance last week in Tampa, the television broadcast crew pronounced his name \\'Buh-day.\\'\\n\\nThe Broncos PR department is top-shelf, and it goes to great length to ensure that player names are pronounced correctly by announcers, commentators, and pundits, by phonetically spelling it out in the annual Media Guide. So why the discrepancy with regard to \\'Bay-dee\\' and \\'Buh-day?\\'\\n\\n\"I actually changed it myself,\" Badie said via Stevens. \"There\\'s some other things going on, some family things that I\\'ll talk about later on. But right now, I\\'m just trying to focus on football now.\"\\n\\nWhat happens next on the Broncos beat? Don\\'t miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second, sign up for our free newsletter, and get breaking Broncos news delivered to your inbox daily!\\n\\nAnd there you have it. Badie himself went to the Broncos after the Media Guide had been released and told him of the pronunciation change, which is how last week\\'s TV broadcast had it right.\\n\\nWith that out of the way, Badie wants to focus on ball, and so do Broncos fans. Now that he\\'s been promoted to the 53-man roster, could Broncos Country expect to see Badie taking a bigger share of the rushing load? Perhaps Broncos offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi\\'s Thursday remarks could hint at an answer.\\n\\n\"I think Tyler is an interesting story because he was a guy we were really excited about last year and he got hurt in training camp,\" Lombardi said. \"When he got healthy, things were kind of in motion and [we] thought he had a really good camp. We were lucky to keep him after training camp, and I think we knew that there was going to be a day this season where he was going to be called up and get his opportunities.\"\\n\\nWith how painful it\\'s been to watch Williams run into his blockers\\' backs, and McLaughlin get quickly swallowed up by tacklers, Badie\\'s explosive first step, and vision for finding the cut-back lane has been refreshing. It\\'s jumped off the screen, so to speak, when studying the film -- beyond simply a change-of-pace type of impact.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think any of us were surprised at what he did,\" Lombardi said of Badie. \"He\\'s a guy that we certainly held in high regard. I was excited when his opportunity came up. I kind of expected him to show out like he did.\"\\n\\nTeams are pretty stubborn when it comes to the players hand-picked to be No. 1 on the depth chart, so while the Broncos would be foolish not to find ways to include Badie more often, it\\'ll be a surprise if it comes at the expense of Williams\\' touch share. There are always exceptions to the rule, but as Lombardi said in reference to last year with Badie\\'s health, things are \"in motion\" now, and that includes Williams as RB1 in the last year of his contract.\\n\\nBroncos Country wants to see Williams -- a 2021 second-round pick whom the team traded up to draft -- succeed and even garner a second contract, but he has clearly held the offense back, which has set Bo Nix and company up for many a second- and third-and-long situations.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know if you need to do -- I don\\'t know if there\\'s a specific step you have to take,\" Lombardi said in regards to Williams and McLaughlin\\'s low rushing averages. \"I mean, obviously, Tyler got in there and had the big run, and he\\'s a guy that we really like. The run game is one of those things where not every run is going to be a 20-yard gain, and you stick with it, thinking you know the players that you have. Just because the stats tell you that they\\'re not gaining a bunch of yards doesn\\'t mean that they\\'ve all of a sudden turned to crap. So you just keep handing them the ball and know that we\\'ll keep getting better, the plan will keep getting better and we\\'ll keep blocking better. Their big runs are coming.\"\\n\\nAs you can see, it doesn\\'t sound like the plan is to eat into Williams\\' touch share, whether it makes sense or not. If anything, expect McLaughlin\\'s bite at the apple to diminish if the Broncos strive to give Badie an expanded role.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just like anything; it\\'s tempting when you\\'ve run the ball a few times early and you\\'re not gaining yards and just say, \\'To heck with this, we\\'re just going to start throwing,\\'\" Lombardi explained. \"The run game is one of those things that if you stick with it, you\\'re going to start busting some runs. It\\'s just a patience thing and just getting better when we do run it.\"\\n\\nHead coach and play-caller Sean Payton has stayed committed to the run, even when it hasn\\'t worked well for the Broncos. That patience paid dividends last week when Badie was inserted into the lineup in the second half, busting off a 43-yard run and helping the Broncos consume the clock and put the Bucs to bed.\\n\\nHowever, in the NFL, the hot hand typically takes precedence -- especially in a running-back-by-committee offense like Payton\\'s. The Broncos would be remiss to ignore Badie\\'s momentum just for the sake of keeping the original plan \"in motion.\"', 'image': 'https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2026,h_1139,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/mile_high_huddle/01j8dw5te3j8574tc94r.jpg', 'sentiment': 0.1058823529411765, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878507', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:01:17Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T00:00:38Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://tnp.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/strong-demand-bidadari-flats-entering-resale-market', 'title': 'Strong demand for Bidadari flats entering resale market', 'body': 'The first flats from the Bidadari housing estate have hit the resale market and analysts say the initial transactions show there is strong demand for flats in the area, especially from young couples looking to buy their first homes.\\n\\nAccording to Housing Board data, four transactions have been lodged for flats in Bidadari Park Drive. Three were four-room flats that transacted for between $937,500 and $1.17 million.\\n\\nThe remaining transaction was a 113 sq m five-room unit that was sold for $1.2 million.\\n\\nSome analysts say the prices could serve as benchmarks for other transactions in the area, while others cautioned against thinking that \"million-dollar\" transactions would be the norm for flats there.\\n\\nThe deals were among the first resale transactions from the new estate, where flats in Alkaff Vista - which comprises 199 four-room and 151 five-room flats - recently fulfilled their five-year minimum occupation period (MOP).\\n\\nBuild-To-Order (BTO) flats in Bidadari were significantly oversubscribed when launched in November 2015, with as many as 20 applicants vying for a five-room unit.\\n\\nNow that the flats can be resold, property agents and analysts say prices reflect the high demand for homes in the area.\\n\\nThey said resale buyers are keen on the units even though it is a new estate because of its convenient location on the city fringe and proximity to amenities such as MRT stations and The Woodleigh Mall.\\n\\nPropNex agent Jayden Chia said he received five offers for the 94 sq m unit in Alkaff Vista and the eventual buyers - a couple in their 30s - agreed to purchase it for $1.08 million in September.\\n\\nThe transaction has yet to be reflected on HDB\\'s website as it takes about three months for a resale transaction to be finalised.\\n\\nMr Chia said most prospective buyers were young couples looking to buy their first home and were drawn by Bidadari\\'s convenient location near Woodleigh and Potong Pasir MRT stations, as well as St Andrew\\'s School.\\n\\nFour-room flats in Alkaff Vista were priced between $433,000 and $550,000 when they were launched in 2015, and five-room units went for $544,000 to $625,000.\\n\\nProfessor Sing Tien Foo, provost\\'s chair professor of real estate at NUS Business School, said the resale prices in Bidadari were unsurprising, pointing out that new flats in other areas on the city fringe, such as Dawson, have also had high transaction prices. While Bidadari is a new estate, Dawson is located within the mature town of Queenstown.\\n\\n\"The strong price appreciation could be due to the high demand for areas where private housing prices could be out of reach for many average-income families,\" he said, citing The Woodleigh Residences condominium, which is priced above $2,000 per sq ft (psf).\\n\\nHe added that the recently transacted prices in Bidadari would prop up resale prices in the area, setting the benchmark for the estate.\\n\\nMs Wong Siew Ying, head of research and content at PropNex, said prices of the Bidadari resale flats were comparable to those of flats with a remaining lease of 94 to 95 years in Toa Payoh, a mature town.\\n\\nFour-room flats in Toa Payoh Apex, near Toa Payoh East, changed hands for $850,000 to about $1.057 million between November 2023 and Sept 17, 2024.\\n\\nMs Christine Sun, chief researcher and strategist at property firm OrangeTee Group, noted that the Bidadari transactions were recorded at prices close to or exceeding $1,000 psf, with the highest at nearly $1,200 psf, an indication of strong demand.\\n\\n\"This psf rate is comparable to what consumers might expect to pay for some older resale condos.\"\\n\\nBut she advised potential buyers to exercise caution and not assume that a \"million-dollar price tag\" was the norm for flats in Bidadari.\\n\\n\"The supply of flats is increasing over time, which may limit future price appreciation,\" she said.\\n\\nThe proportion of million-dollar resale flat transactions has grown but remains small, accounting for about 2 per cent of all transactions in the past 1½ years, the Ministry of National Development said in August.\\n\\nOnly 0.5 per cent of four-room and smaller flats transacted in the past two years were sold for a million dollars or more.\\n\\nMore resale flats in Bidadari are expected to come onto the market, with the 531-unit Alkaff LakeView reaching its MOP in the coming months, and the 1,258-unit Alkaff CourtView in 2025.\\n\\nChecks on Sept 25 showed more than 40 listings for resale flats in Alkaff Vista across listing platforms such as PropertyGuru, 99.co and the HDB Flat Portal.\\n\\nMs Wong said demand will likely remain strong for flats in Bidadari. She pointed out that the new Prime, Plus and Standard flat classification, which will kick in from the BTO exercise in October, could channel interest to well-located resale flats, such as those in Bidadari, which do not have significant resale restrictions.\\n\\nFrom October, new BTO units closer to amenities like MRT stations and town centres will fall under the Prime and Plus categories. These flats will come with stricter resale conditions such as a 10-year MOP and a subsidy clawback.\\n\\n\"Some prospective buyers may not be willing to be subjected to these stricter conditions and the longer MOP and they may decide to buy a resale flat in attractive locations instead,\" she said.\\n\\nThe Bidadari estate consists of 12 BTO developments across four districts - Alkaff, Bartley Heights, Park Edge and Woodleigh. The Alkaff and Woodleigh districts have been completed, with the remaining two districts set for completion by mid-2025.', 'image': 'https://tnp.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/rl680/public/ilbidadari19.aea9ce87.Attachment.101124.jpg?itok=BKn2XyGE', 'sentiment': 0.1215686274509804, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878683', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:01:18Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T00:00:57Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.8352941274642944, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13896521/Giada-Laurentiis-lookalike-daughter-Jade-singing-band.html', 'title': 'Giada De Laurentiis, shares video of daughter Jade singing', 'body': 'Giada De Laurentiis shared a group of photos and video clips celebrating her summer memories on Instagram.\\n\\n\\'& that\\'s a wrap for summer 2024,\\' she captioned the post, adding a crying emoji.\\n\\nIncluded in that group was a video of her lookalike daughter Jade Marie De Laurentiis-Thompson, 16, singing with her band, The Hours.\\n\\nJade can be seen singing lead vocals nearby a train station, possibly engaging in the tradition of busking.\\n\\nThe Food Network star - who had sinus surgery earlier this year - shares Jade with her ex-husband, fashion designer Todd Thompson.\\n\\nGiada De Laurentiis shared a group of photos and video clips celebrating her summer memories on Instagram. \\'& that\\'s a wrap for summer 2024,\\' she captioned the post, adding a crying emoji\\n\\nRead More Giada De Laurentiis sends look-alike daughter Jade \\'off to prom\\'\\n\\nGiada frequently shares snaps with her only child on her social media and she has a lot more time to do that now that she has retired from The Food Network after 21 years as one of the network\\'s biggest stars.\\n\\nTo put it simply, she was burnt out as she told Rebecca Minkoff on her Superwoman podcast recently.\\n\\n\\'I would switch gears without knowing it every seven years,\\' she explained.\\n\\n\\'So I did Everyday Italian for seven years, then I got pregnant, and I was like, \"OK, I can\\'t do that show anymore.

Partly because Astro Bot was reminding me of a lot of classic PS1 games I used to love and partly because Dino Crisis and Legacy Of Kain are getting a comeback via PS Plus and they were two of my favourite games back in the day.\\n\\nI have no idea how they play now though and have a feeling they may not have aged well. So I ask you: what is the best PS1 game, in terms of something you could play now? I know it's not Ape Escape, which I loved in Astro Bot, because that had a bad camera and controls even back in the day. Metal Gear Solid was also fiddly even at the time and Final Fantasy 7 is so badly translated it's almost unplayable now.\\n\\nI think the better picks are probably simple action games, that don't really age, like Tekken or Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Resident Evil 2 is great, I love it, but the tank controls are so of their time. Timelessness is not something most PS1 games have but ironically it may be 2D games like Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night and Final Fantasy Tactics that have lasted the best.\\n\\nSting\\n\\nExpected answer\\n\\nIt's funny that it's their new museum that's got Nintendo talking, rather than anything to do with the Switch 2, but I can't fault Miyamoto-san on anything he said this week. I am very glad to see them take a clear stance on AI but then again, I'd be very surprised and disappointed if they had gone all in on it. Not even Xbox has done that yet, although I fear that's coming sooner or later.\\n\\nHim describing how Nintendo wasn't interesting in getting into the rat race of high-end consoles was very reassuring to here. We've seen exactly where the opposite has got us: games that are too expensive to make and consoles whose main selling points are impossible to see with the naked eye and yet cost £700.\\n\\nI'm not saying PlayStation and Xbox shouldn't try and make better graphics, but they have to show some restraint and they've shown none whatsoever. Nintendo could've made the Switch as powerful as PlayStation 4 if they decided to charge £960 for it (the price of a PS5 Pro special edition) but because they're not crazy they didn't.\\n\\nDogger\\n\\nWeird idea\\n\\nLots of Nintendo stories on Thursday but interesting stuff all round. Not surprised to hear Nintendo doesn't like AI but it's good to hear anyway. Not wanting to get involved in the console wars is also a given but also nice to hear said out loud.\\n\\nI do wonder what this wireless, possibly wearable, device is though. I agree the time limit it on it makes it sound like it's something that's going to come out early, so what is Nintendo thinking? A reader mentioned Miis the other day and this new gadget got me thinking that I'd like to see a return of something similar to StreetPass again.\\n\\nIt was very simple, but I found it very fun picking up people's Mii whenever I went out. So I wonder if this device is doing something similar? I'm sure the Switch can do the wireless stuff itself but maybe there's more complicated interactions being planned with AR or similar? Just a thought and I'm sure whatever it is it'll end up being too weird for any of us to imagine - in a good way.\\n\\nCuscus\\n\\nEmail your comments to: gamecentral@metro.co.uk\\n\\nAdvanced reading\\n\\nI'm not usually someone who gets hyped for games before they've been reviewed. But I'm making an exception for the upcoming Exodus game. Not only is it being developed by some of the staff who previously worked on Mass Effect and Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic (two of my favourite role-playing games) but it also features the voice talents of Matthew McConaughey (one of my favourite actors, particularly in Interstellar).\\n\\nMost importantly though, the developers have aquired the sci-fi writing talents of best-selling author Peter F. Hamilton (one of my favourite authors), who has not only been brought in as a creative consultant, but is writing two whole novels set in the universe he's created for the game.\\n\\nI'm currently enjoying the first of these, The Archimedes Engine, and it's up to the usual high standards of his writing, with bags of intrigue, depth, and creative world-building. It gives me certainty that the game's universe will be an interesting and unique one, and hope that we may get a better ending than that of the Mass Effect series!\\n\\nFor any fans of sci-fi (or good books in general) who might be interested in reading some of his other work, I'd recommend starting with the excellent Commonwealth Saga (Comprised of Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained) as it will probably a while before the second book to his Exodus series is finished!\\n\\nDan\\n\\nUnrequited love\\n\\nI don't know what can be said about this PS5 Pro 30th anniversary business. I'm all for calling Sony out on the price of the normal model but anyone that's paying £8,000 for the same thing but painted grey has only got themselves to blame. I've no sympathy, even if it seems that Sony didn't do anything to stop scalpers.\\n\\nBut the idea that it was £960 even before the scalpers is incredible to me. Okay if you're a millionaire and just enjoy wasting your money but ordinary people could buy 14 ordinary full price games or more for the same price. Spending that sort of money on a console to celebrate a corporate brand's anniversary... I can guarantee you Sony don't love you as much as you love them.\\n\\nMendas\\n\\nDystopian joy\\n\\nIt's all a bit doom and gloom in gaming right now, so I thought I would cheer myself up a bit by purchasing Frostpunk (a bit of irony for you there). Admittedly, I don't think I had even heard of the game until your review of the sequel but having read it I decided to check out the original, which to my luck is currently on sale on the PlayStation Store and combined with a PlayStation Stars voucher cost me all of £2. What a bargain that turned out to be (although at £2 the bar wasn't too high).\\n\\nI'm obsessed with it and time seems to no longer work the way it used to. Hours ebb away, as I do my best to keep everyone in town warm and my mind is constantly thinking of what I need to do next when I'm not playing it.\\n\\nUsually this isn't the sort of game I would play but this isn't the first time giving something different a go has paid off by following one of your recommendations. I've been here before with Crusader Kings 3, which I became equally enthralled with.\\n\\nI guess what I'm really trying to say is we could perhaps all benefit from giving something different a go whilst we wait for Sony and Microsoft et al. to sort themselves out.\\n\\nI'm going to take my own advice and give something like Paper Mario or the new Zelda game a go next.\\n\\nHappy gaming everyone.\\n\\nVanhelsing21\\n\\nGC: Our favourite letters are always those from readers who have been inspired to try something different as a result of one of our reviews.\\n\\nMarket value\\n\\n£8,000 for a PlayStation?

But saying that, you will get some paying it which is a shame because while people are paying it they will carry on doing it.\\n\\nDavid\\n\\nNo complaints\\n\\nA couple of interesting articles today, the first is the price hike of Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition to £34.99, leading up to the more extensive than expected PlayStation 5 remaster. Evil, rip-off Sony on the surface. The article's top picture had a comment saying good graphics don't come cheap.\\n\\nYet Nintendo has spent the Switch era releasing much of the Wii U catalogue at full price with no upgrade path, like Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. So on Switch, PlayStation 3 era graphics don't come cheap. In fairness people have criticised this too, although not to the level Sony gets.\\n\\nNintendo game prices don't ever dome down, you'll probably never get their current games for less than £35. Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition has been available for £15 for years. It was also given away free by Sony during their Covid PlayStation's Play At Home initiative and that free version can be upgraded for £10. That sounds like positively decent behaviour to me.\\n\\nFor me, there's a difference to being ripped off and a company trying to be profitable and selling things at a fair price. I've no real problem with Nintendo or Sony here and feel they both offer good value on their platforms.\\n\\nThe second article was Nintendo not following the same path as high-end consoles in pushing the console price and development budget-busting graphical/performance envelope. What's sad though is Nintendo has to make this point as there's a subset of gamers who feel Nintendo's approach of releasing tech that's behind the technology curve deserves criticising.\\n\\nI'm happy both schools of thought exist and I get the best of both worlds. But I do feel the high-end console market could do with being a bit more Nintendo here and take a break from improving graphics. It's a mild pet peeve for me and feels like chasing the dragon when people say the PS5 Pro is needed, rather than a nice/unnecessary option depending on your point of view, as the base PlayStation 5 can't run the latest and greatest at 60fps on quality settings. It's an endless pursuit where you'll never be truly satiated.\\n\\nOverall though, across Xbox, PC, Switch, and PlayStation the industry offers an excellent selection of gaming goodness.

Although Pakistan\\'s hydrocarbon resources are yet to be quantified, some estimates suggest that this discovery constitutes the fourth-largest oil and gas reserves in the world. However, the oil majors appear unimpressed: in July, the country\\'s Petroleum Minister, Musadik Malik, told a parliamentary committee that no international companies were interested in offshore oil and gas exploration in Pakistan,and those in the country largely had the exit door in view. It comes down to security, and risk versus reward with Malik explaining to the committee that the cost of security is a major deal-breaker because \"in areas where companies search for oil and gas, they have to spend a significant amount to maintain security for their employees and assets.\"\\n\\nThankfully for Pakistan\\'s neighbor, India has no such baggage. India\\'s oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has called for oil majors to step up oil and gas exploration in the country to help cut India\\'s reliance on imports and make affordable fuel sustainable.\\n\\n\"E&P offers investment opportunities worth USD 100 billion by 2030,\" he told a conference at Urja Varta.\\n\\nCurrently, only 10% of India\\'s 3.36 million sq km wide sedimentary basin is under exploration. However, the country is richly endowed with fossil fuels: back in July, S&P Global Commodity Insights revealed that four largely unexplored sedimentary basins in India could hold up to 22 billion barrels of oil. In effect, lesser-known Category II and III basins, namely Mahanadi, Andaman Sea, Bengal, and Kerala-Konkan contain more oil than the Permian Basin, which has already produced 14 billion barrels of its 34 billion recoverable oil reserves.\\n\\nRelated: OPEC+ Confirms it Has No Specific Price Target For Crude Oil\\n\\nRahul Chauhan, an upstream analyst at Commodity Insights, has emphasized the potential of India\\'s unexplored Oil & Gas sector, \"ONGC and Oil India hold acreages in the Andaman waters under the Open Acreage Licensing Program (OALP) and have planned a few significant projects. However, India still awaits the entry of an international oil company with deepwater and ultra-deepwater exploration expertise to participate in current and upcoming OALP bidding rounds and explore these frontier regions,\" he has declared.\\n\\nBig Oil Kicks Off India Exploration\\n\\nIndia boasts significant discoveries in the Krishna-Godavari, Barmer, and Assam basins, but exploration in other areas has been slower to develop. Of India\\'s 3.14 million square kilometers of sedimentary basins, 1.3 million sq km are in deep waters. India had its first foray into deepwater exploration in the Bay of Bengal earlier this year in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, courtesy of India\\'s state run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). ONGC said it was planning to spend over $10 billion developing multiple deepwater projects in its KG-DWN-98/2 block in that basin.\\n\\nMeanwhile, state-owned upstream company Oil India Ltd is looking to start exploration activities in Nagaland\\n\\n\"We have a total of 30 blocks under the OALP. We have already drilled all wells under the awarded OALP blocks, except in Nagaland. We are pursuing the ministry and they have set up a high power committee involving OIL, ONGC, government officials, to discuss the issue with the Government of Nagaland and resume exploration,\" the official said.\\n\\nUnlike Pakistan, India is likely to have little trouble attracting the oil and gas majors. Indeed, British energy giant BP Plc (NYSE:BP) is holding a board meeting in India this week, as it hunts for more opportunities in the country. BP has forged a joint venture with Indian multinational conglomerate Reliance Industries to operate 1,900 fuel retail stations across India and produces oil and gas from a deepwater block in the Krishna-Godavari basin. The JV has teamed up with ONGC to bid for exploration rights for an offshore block in India.\\n\\nNational oil companies (NOCs) account for 58% of global reserves and 56% of production. However, International Oil Companies (IOCs) also play a major role in the energy sector by contributing to the general economic and social development of the host country. Indeed, IOCs are obliged through Production Sharing Agreement to pay royalty fees to the host country.\\n\\nAnalysts have predicted that India is set to become the key driver of global oil demand growth, overtaking China.\\n\\n\"China\\'s role as a global oil demand growth engine is fading fast,\" Emma Richards, senior analyst at London-based Fitch Solutions Ltd, told The Times of India. According to the analyst, over the next decade, China\\'s share of emerging market oil demand growth will decline from nearly 50% to just 15% while India\\'s share will double to 24%.\\n\\nA rapidly growing population, which has likely surpassed China\\'s, is expected to be the main driver of consumption trends in India. Meanwhile, the country\\'s transition from traditional gasoline and diesel-fueled transport is expected to lag other regions, in sharp contrast to China\\'s skyrocketing adoption of electric vehicles and clean energy in general.\\n\\n\"India was always going to exceed China in a matter of time in terms of being the global demand growth driver, mainly due to demographic factors like population growth,\" Parsley Ong, the head of Asia energy and chemicals research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Hong Kong, has told Bloomberg.', 'image': 'https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2024-09-26_x8osqf0iak.jpg', 'sentiment': 0.3411764705882352, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338878715', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:01:26Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T00:01:04Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.529411792755127, 'url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/weir-internationals-not-rolling-over-after-nightmare-presidents-cup-start-4641611', 'title': 'Weir: Internationals not rolling over after nightmare Presidents Cup start', 'body': 'Canadian Mike Weir\\'s International Team endured a nightmare start to the Presidents Cup on Thursday but the former Masters champion insisted his squad still believe they have time to turn things around and end the Americans\\' dominant run.\\n\\nThe U.S., who entered the week as a prohibitive favorite to secure a 10th consecutive Presidents Cup, swept the opening day fourballs session at Royal Montreal Golf Club 5-0, leaving many to wonder what, if anything, Weir\\'s team needs to change.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s certainly not the team unity and the team spirit.

Crew members - including aviation survival technician Philip Morie and helicopter pilot Lt. Katherine McDonnell - were notified that \"an 8-year-old male passenger onboard was diagnosed with appendicitis and needed to be medevaced.\"\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t have it in sight, which from 10 miles out, flying at like 300 or 400 feet ...

Footage shows Morie rappelling down to hoist the boy into a large metal rescue basket before the helicopter lifted him into its compartment.\\n\\n\"On the way up, you know, I\\'m just still talking to the kid and, you know, giving him high fives and trying to keep him calm,\" Morie noted. Throughout the medevac situation, Daniel told the outlet he kept his eyes shut the entire time.\\n\\nTwo more of Daniel\\'s family members - his mother Nicole and brother - were taken up in the basket as well.\\n\\nNicole explained what happened at the time, saying: \"The doctor in the cruise said the situation is very [much an] emergency ...

Tens of thousands of Israeli and Lebanese people living near their countries\\' border have been displaced by the fighting.\\n\\nNetanyahu spoke as he landed in New York to attend the annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, where U.S. and European officials were putting heavy pressure on both sides of the conflict to accept a proposed 21-day halt in the fighting to give time for diplomacy and avert all-out war.\\n\\nNearly 700 people have been killed in Lebanon this week as Israel dramatically escalated strikes, saying it is targeting Hezbollah\\'s military capacities. Israeli leaders say they are determined to stop the group\\'s cross-border attacks, which began after Hamas\\' Oct. 7 attack that ignited the war in Gaza.\\n\\nIsrael\\'s \"policy is clear,\" Netanyahu said. \"We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force. And we will not stop until we reach all our goals, chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes.\"\\n\\nJust before his comments, the Israeli military said it killed a Hezbollah drone commander, Mohammed Hussein Surour, in an airstrike in the suburbs of Beirut. Hezbollah later confirmed Surour\\'s death.\\n\\nThe Health Ministry said two people were killed and 15 wounded in the strike. Associated Press photos of the scene showed a gutted apartment in a residential building in Dahiyeh, the mainly Shiite suburb where Hezbollah has a strong presence.\\n\\nUntil recently, Israel had rarely targeted sites in Beirut during the low-level conflict with Hezbollah that has been ongoing since October. However, in the past week, Israel has struck Beirut\\'s southern suburbs several times.\\n\\nOver the past week, Israel has carried out several strikes in Beirut targeting senior Hezbollah commanders. One strike in eastern Lebanon on Thursday killed 20 people, most of them Syrian migrants, according to Lebanese health officials.\\n\\nIsrael hit 75 sites early Thursday across southern and eastern Lebanon and launched a new wave of strikes in the evening, the military said. Throughout the day, Hezbollah fired some 175 projectiles into Israel, the Israeli military said. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, sparking some wildfires, though one rocket hit a street in a town near the northern city of Safed.\\n\\nIsrael has talked of a possible ground invasion into Lebanon to drive Hezbollah -- an Iranian-backed Shiite group that is the strongest armed force in Lebanon -- away from the border. It has moved thousands of troops to the north in preparation. Some 100,000 Lebanese have fled their homes in the past week, streaming into Beirut and points further north.\\n\\nIsraeli military vehicles transported tanks and armored vehicles toward the country\\'s northern border with Lebanon a day after commanders issued a call-up of reservists. Several tanks arrived in Kiryat Shmona, a hard-hit town just several miles from the border.\\n\\nOn another front, Israel\\'s military on Friday said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen that set off air raid sirens across the country\\'s center. Sirens rang out across Israel\\'s populous central area, including the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv. Another missile from Yemen landed in central Israel about two weeks ago.\\n\\nThe escalation has raised fears of a repeat - or worse - of the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah that wreaked destruction across southern Lebanon and other parts of the country and saw heavy Hezbollah rocket fire on Israeli cities.\\n\\n\"Another full-scale war could be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said after talks with his British and Australian counterparts in London.\\n\\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was at the U.N. meeting with Israeli officials over the truce proposal. Speaking in an interview with MSNBC, he said major powers, the Europeans and Arab nations were united, \"everyone speaking with one clear voice about the need to get that cease-fire in the north.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t speak for him,\" Blinken said of Netanyahu.\\n\\nHezbollah has not yet responded to the proposal. Lebanon\\'s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed it, but his government has no sway over the group.\\n\\nNetanyahu\\'s office downplayed the initiative, saying in a statement that it was only a proposal.\\n\\nOne of Netanyahu\\'s far-right governing partners threatened on Thursday to suspend cooperation with his government if it signs onto a temporary cease-fire with Hezbollah - and to quit completely if a permanent deal is reached. It was the latest sign of displeasure from Netanyahu\\'s allies toward international cease-fire efforts.\\n\\n\"If a temporary cease-fire becomes permanent, we will resign from the government,\" said National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, head of the Jewish Power party.\\n\\nIf Ben-Gvir leaves the coalition, Netanyahu would lose his parliamentary majority and could see his government come toppling down, though opposition leaders have said they would offer support for a cease-fire deal.\\n\\nHezbollah has insisted it would halt its strikes only if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, where Israel has battled Hamas for nearly a year. That appears out of reach despite months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.\\n\\nOne day after Hamas\\' Oct 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel, bringing Israeli counterfire and a cycle of reprisals that has gone on near daily since. Hezbollah says its barrages are a show of support for Palestinians and that it is targeting Israeli military facilities, though rockets have also hit civilian areas.\\n\\nBefore this week, the cross-border exchanges had killed about 600 people in Lebanon, mostly militants but including more than 100 civilians, and about four dozen people in Israel, roughly half of them soldiers and the rest civilians. The fighting also forced tens of thousands to flee homes on both sides of the border.\\n\\nIsrael says its escalated strikes across Lebanon the past week are targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. Since Monday, strikes have killed more than 690 people in Lebanon, around a quarter of them women and children, according to local health authorities.\\n\\nThe campaign opened with what is widely believed to be an Israeli attack on Sept. 18 and 19 detonating thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, killing at least 39 people and maiming thousands more, including civilians.\\n\\nHezbollah in turn has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel. Several people in Israel have been wounded. On Wednesday, the group fired on Tel Aviv for the first time with a longer-range missile that was intercepted.\\n\\nEarly Thursday, an Israeli airstrike hit a building housing Syrian workers and their families near the ancient city of Baalbek in Lebanon\\'s eastern Bekaa Valley. The Lebanese Health Ministry said 19 Syrians and a Lebanese were killed, one of the deadliest single strikes in Israel\\'s intensified air campaign.\\n\\nHussein Salloum, a local official in Younine, said most of the dead were women and children.

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images / Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\\n\\nIt follows that a team doubling down on veterans would also undervalue the draft and struggle in talent evaluation. All of that fits together. If talent evaluation falls short, the team has to turn to veterans in trade and free agency, as the draft takes on a lesser role.\\n\\nChristian McCaffrey and Trent Williams acquired through trade. The impact drafted players on offense currently led by two seventh rounders (Brock Purdy and Jauan Jennings) and an undrafted free agent (Jordan Mason).\\n\\nThe primary example of poor talent evaluation and undervaluing the draft, the trade for Trey Lance. Three first-round picks for the wrong guy. Also the trade for McCaffrey, it proved worthwhile but the cost in draft capital was high, showing a team that doesn\\'t place their highest priority on the draft, giving up picks in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds.\\n\\nThe 49ers have been saved by comp picks in the draft, if not for that, draft picks would have been scarce. The comp picks essentially saved the Niners from themselves and their preference to move picks for vets.\\n\\nTHE DRAFT\\n\\nThe 49ers hit rate in the draft has been poor in the early rounds (through the 4th) and outstanding late (5th through 7th). That speaks to misses by Kyle Shanahan early and a weakness in his talent evaluation.\\n\\nSince Shanahan and John Lynch took over in 2017, in the first four rounds the Niners have drafted two impact starters on offense and two on defense: Deebo Samuel, Brandon Aiyuk, Fred Warner, and Nick Bosa.\\n\\nThe Samuel pick stemmed from Shanahan coaching at the Senior Bowl and seeing Deebo live. Credit to Shanahan that he identified the talent, but is the pick made if Shanahan wasn\\'t at Mobile? Fortunate.\\n\\nThe Aiyuk pick was on a recommendation from then-Arizona State coach Herm Edwards to his buddy Lynch. The Bosa pick was a gimme at #2 overall. So the lone impact player in the first four rounds that was scouted and picked is Warner.\\n\\nBy the numbers\\n\\nOn offense in the first four rounds, two impact starters in Samuel and Aiyuk out of 15 picks, nine busts. An impact hit rate of 13% and a bust rate of 75%. The nine busts all Shanahan picks at quarterback, running back, wide receiver, and tight end. That\\'s the danger of having an offensive coordinator picking for his offense out of self-interest as the defacto GM.\\n\\nOn defense in the first four rounds, two impact starters in Warner and Bosa out of eleven picks with six busts. An impact hit rate of 18% and a bust rate of 54%.\\n\\nWhy do the 49ers lack impact young talent, especially on defense? Poor talent evaluation with too many busts, and a bias toward offense picks, all to be expected under Shanahan. As a reminder, on roles and responsibilities, this quote from Lynch, \"Kyle has the 53, I have the 90.\"\\n\\nAll the picks through four rounds and only one of them an impact starter as a product of scouting and selection with no special circumstances. When I say that Shanahan is the biggest barrier to a 49ers championship, poor talent evaluation like this is a key part of why.\\n\\nThe evaluation weakness is further compounded by Shanahan\\'s clear bias for veterans, and players fully versed in his system. Purdy, Mason, and Jennings were all buried or with limited roles until injury forced them on the field.\\n\\nShanahan\\'s bias played out in the Rams game late with Ronnie Bell inexplicably on the field and targeted with the game on the line, despite a drop earlier in the game, and a camp with more of the same.\\n\\nPoor talent evaluation can also lead to overvaluing players from Bell to a reliance on Jake Brendel at center and Colton McKivitz at right tackle. Shanahan\\'s cap philosophy of using the offensive line as a cap-savings center comes at a cost on the field. Would Brendel or McKivitz start on any other team? Probably not.\\n\\nThe offensive line is also hurt by another Shanahan bias, this time in the draft, not to draft offensive linemen early. That bias then plays into another GM mistake, not using what the draft gives you. The best OL class in a decade, and only one pick is used on the line. A big credit to Shanahan that the pick is Dominic Puni, who looks like a great find, but imagine if more linemen from this class were taken given what Puni has shown as a 3rd rounder.\\n\\nThe evaluation weakness also plays out in free agency. Javon Hargrave, an unfortunate injury, but he hasn\\'t played up to his contract.

Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - BMBL', 'body': 'NEW YORK, Sept. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\\n\\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of all purchasers of securities of Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ: BMBL) between November 7, 2023 and August 7, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 25, 2024\\n\\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Bumble securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\\n\\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Bumble class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3076 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 25, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\\n\\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\\' Bar. Many of the firm\\'s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Bumble\\'s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth on the back of its tiered-subscription options and subsequent app relaunch, while also downplaying the potential disruption to Bumble\\'s brand and reputation caused by the imminent change in leadership. In truth, Bumble\\'s Premium Plus subscription plan did not have a clear market fit and would very quickly need to be revamped. Bumble\\'s tiered-subscription options were ill equipped to provide the claimed revenue per user benefit to Bumble\\'s faltering market share, particularly regarding user growth and monetization. Defendants misled investors by providing the public with materially flawed statements of confidence and growth projections which did not account for these variables. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\\n\\nTo join the Bumble class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3076or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\\n\\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.

Named after Perry's 'angel number'\\n\\nRead More Oasis: Definitely Maybe (30th Anniversary Edition) review: A masterpiece gets a supersonic reboot\\n\\nHer summer comeback single Woman's World was widely panned, as was her decision to resume her creative partnership with one of her original collaborators Lukasz Gottwald (aka Dr. Luke), a producer who was accused of sexual, physical and emotional abuse by the singer Kesha. Gottwald, who denied any wrongdoing, countersued Kesha for defamation and a long-running lawsuit was finally settled out of court last year.\\n\\nPerry reasserted her pop credentials with a powerful performance at this month's Video Music Awards in New York, revisiting classic hits such as Firework -- but a return to the fray that should have soared like a mini-rocket has so far proved a damp squib.\\n\\nDespite all that, 143 manages to avoid being an unmitigated disaster. Named after Perry's 'angel number' (the numerical shorthand for I Love You), it has its moments. There are some passable, if dated, dance numbers plus two touching songs inspired by her four-year-old daughter Daisy and the latter's dad, Hollywood star Orlando Bloom.\\n\\nThe first of these, Lifetimes, is an ebullient, house-style banger. The second, Wonder, provides the album with its show-stopping, theatrical finale, one in which Daisy has a fleeting cameo. 'Stay pure, beautiful girl,' sings Perry.\\n\\nElsewhere, however, the 39-year-old singer chases trends without any real conviction or sense of fun. On the slinky Gimme Gimme and Crush, her voice is annoyingly coated in auto-tune, while the revenge song I'm His, He's Mine contains an incongruous sample from Crystal Waters's Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless), a 1991 single about a destitute busker.\\n\\nThe Perry of old emerges only in flashes. All The Love, which starts as an electronic ballad before the pace quickens, allows her to finally open up her voice.\\n\\nBut much of 143 feels generic and laboured, its failings thrown into sharper relief by the rise of a new wave of wittily inventive, less calculating pop goddesses. Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and others have upped the ante. In contrast, this is devoid of the simple musical pleasures that once made Katy so captivating.\\n\\nPIXIE LOTT: Encino (BMG)\\n\\nVerdict: Unexpected reinvention\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nPixie Lott was one of several female singers who emerged in the slipstream of Amy Winehouse in the late 2000s. Her first two singles, Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh) and Boys And Girls, both topped the UK charts in 2009 by channelling\\n\\na retro-soul sound clearly inspired by Amy. She reached No. 1 again, two years later, with All About Tonight, cementing her status as one of the era's leading party girls.\\n\\nNow making a musical comeback after a decade that has seen her pivot to the stage and TV, the Essex-raised singer has taken an unexpected turn, edging away from dance to something more classic and band-orientated. Maybe we shouldn't be quite so surprised, though: when I spoke to her in 2009, Lott confessed she was a pop princess who often felt 'more hippy, vintage and indie' -- and she gleefully explores all those traits on Encino.\\n\\nPixie Lott was one of several female singers who emerged in the slipstream of Amy Winehouse in the late 2000s\\n\\nCo-writing every track here, the maturing Pixie Lott also exorcises a few of her demons in the album\\n\\nMade in Los Angeles with producers Dave Gibson and Jeeve, the 33-year-old's first album since 2014 makes the most of her naturally versatile, expressive voice. There's an Adele-like richness to Further From Love, while the acoustic-based Show You Love, all strummed guitars and mandolin, taps into this year's country-pop trend. Co-writing every track here, the maturing Lott also exorcises a few of her demons, addressing online bullying on Somebody's Daughter and her battles with insomnia on Midnight Trash. The bruised piano ballad Say So, sung in a fragile falsetto, was inspired by what she says was an emotionally draining, three-month stint playing Holly Golightly in the 2016 West End adaptation of Breakfast At Tiffany's.\\n\\nBut the overall mood is buoyant. The nostalgic Blockbuster Video harks back to a time when watching a film at home meant a rented VHS tape rather than a digital stream. Another country-ish tune, Happy, has taken on fresh meaning for Lott since she gave birth to a son, Albert, last year. The album closes with Comes Back Around, an acoustic song about learning from mistakes that takes inspiration from T. S. Eliot's war-time poem Little Gidding. If that doesn't banish Pixie's frothy image, surely nothing will.\\n\\nBEST OF THE NEW RELEASESFAIRGROUND ATTRACTION\\n\\nBeautiful Happening (Raresong)\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nMark Nevin's band definitely live up to the billing on a comeback album that comes 34 years later\\n\\nSongwriter Mark Nevin once said that Fairground Attraction were 'jazz musicians playing pop on folk instruments', and his band definitely live up to the billing on a comeback album that arrives 34 long years after we last heard from them on 1990's Ay Fond Kiss.\\n\\nGatecrashing Heaven, beautifully sung by Eddi Reader, is a doo-wop ballad, and What's Wrong With The World? (answer: 'maybe it's me') harks back to their debut hit Perfect. Still able to conjure up a winning hook, the band will begin a UK reunion tour tomorrow night at the Wulfrun Hall at the University of Wolverhampton.\\n\\nTHE VOIDZ\\n\\nLike All Before You (Cult)\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nThis latest album skips haphazardly between electronic pop, guitar tracks and ambient piano pieces\\n\\nAs the lead singer and main creative force with The Strokes, Julian Casablancas was a pivotal figure in the garage-rock boom of the 2000s. With his other group, The Voidz, he is more adventurous, rather like Blur's Damon Albarn is in Gorillaz.\\n\\nCasablancas' eclectic instincts, however, can sometimes get the better of him, and that's certainly true here. This latest album skips haphazardly between electronic pop, guitar tracks and ambient piano pieces. Flexorcist, with its echoes of early New York hip-hop and 1908s electro, is a highlight -- although fans of The Strokes are warned to approach with caution.\\n\\nMJ LENDERMAN\\n\\nManning Fireworks (Anti-)\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nMark Jacob Lenderman plays most of the instruments himself on the album but his guitar heroics take centre staf\\n\\nThe new hope of Americana, North Carolina singer-songwriter Mark Jacob Lenderman puts a country-ish slant on 1990s indie-rock.\\n\\nThe former ice-cream salesman plays most of the instruments himself, but it's his guitar heroics that take centre stage, ragged on the title track, heavier on Bark At The Moon, an homage to Ozzy Osbourne. His witty lyrics catch the ear, too, with pop culture references abounding. There's a nod to The Band on You Don't Know The Shape I'm In, and On My Knees has a reference to 'Travolta's bald head'.\\n\\nShe's Leaving You tells of a middle-aged philanderer who believes Eric Clapton 'was the second coming'.\\n\\nEmanuel Feuermann Edition\\n\\n(Sony 19439977442, seven CDs)\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nThis box includes everything Feuermann recorded for RCA Victor, and if you can be patient with sound quality from 1939-41\\n\\nKilled by medical bungling in 1942, aged 39, Emanuel Feuermann is still regarded by cellists with awe and envy.\\n\\nThis box includes everything Feuermann recorded for RCA Victor, and if you can be patient with sound quality from 1939-41, you will find his tone quite irresistible.

Set against a backdrop of sun-faded apricots, blushes and soft whites, the Paris collection captured Kamali\\'s vision of a summer that she surmised as: \"when you pause, escape, explore and recharge.\" It celebrated Chloé\\'s free-spirited DNA, infused with a lightness that felt both nostalgic and forward-looking.\\n\\nHere are some highlights of Thursday\\'s shows at Paris Fashion Week, including when Naomi Campbell was awarded a prestigious honor in France:\\n\\nKamali\\'s joyful freedom\\n\\n\"There\\'s a liberating expression of total freedom,\" Kamali said, of her spring display.\\n\\nThis freedom flowed through silk charmeuse gowns, lingerie-inspired crop tops and peek-a-boo designs.\\n\\nEchoes of Karl Lagerfeld\\'s 70s Chloé lingered in exaggerated shoulders and standout pieces, like a loose-fitting, vivid blue coat. \"Chloé is not a passing moment; it\\'s an eternal state of mind,\" Kamali noted, grounding her collection in the house\\'s long-standing ethos of optimism and instinct.\\n\\nLayering played a central role, but Kamali kept it light and intuitive, reflecting what she called a \"very personal way of dressing.\" Sheer fabrics and sun-worn lace mixed effortlessly with ribbed jerseys, creating looks that felt weightless and spontaneous, a signature of Kamali\\'s debut collection. \"What matters to me is the feeling and intuition,\" she said.\\n\\nA standout moment came in the form of a dramatic trapeze-shaped silk gown, its dynamic silhouette swirling with movement. It epitomized Kamali\\'s ability to honor Chloé\\'s romantic roots while infusing a modern sensibility. \"The mood is light, weightless, sensual and joyful,\" she explained. That joyful freedom was a defining thread from start to finish.\\n\\nWith her second outing, Kamali proved she is the right designer to lead Chloé. She crafted a spring collection that balanced nostalgia and sensuality while pushing the house toward a bright, optimistic future.\\n\\nMugler\\'s Cadwallader takes a bite at fashion\\n\\nCasey Cadwallader delivered a striking debut for Mugler, equal parts theatrical and innovative. The hair, sculpted into harsh fringes like a viper\\'s fang, set the tone for a collection defined by sharp architectural lines. Curving lapels adorned tight jackets, while tendrils of latticed silk flowed into skirts that bled vibrant yellows, creating a visual spectacle.\\n\\nThe collection boldly embraced femininity, featuring a bust that echoed the form of seashells and a densely packed bustier resembling a diving whale. This daring aesthetic aligns with Cadwallader\\'s aim to infuse the brand with a fresh energy, moving away from the extravagance that some original Mugler fans long for. However, the theatrical elements, while captivating, may prompt questions about whether they overshadow the essence of traditional fashion presentation.\\n\\nOversized tubular arms complemented a webbed skirt-coat, while a transparent loose trench evoked the look of a sea medusa, reinforcing Cadwallader\\'s commitment to pushing boundaries. This collection showcases a provocative take on body-conscious design and inclusivity, aiming to resonate with a diverse audience.\\n\\nYet, Cadwallader\\'s choice to prioritize multimedia and performance raises concerns. Critics may feel this direction dilutes the brand\\'s identity, diverting from the high-fashion roots that established Mugler\\'s reputation. The sentiment that the house is now focused more on entertainment than on pure fashion is a conversation that continues to unfold.\\n\\nAs the audience reacted with applause, it was clear that while not everyone may embrace this new vision, those who do are eager for more.\\n\\nNaomi Campbell honored in France amid charity controversy\\n\\nIconic British model Naomi Campbell was awarded a prestigious honor in France, being named a knight in the Order of Arts and Letters at the country\\'s culture ministry for her significant contributions to French culture.\\n\\nHowever, this recognition comes as Campbell faces scrutiny back home, having been barred from serving as a charity trustee in England and Wales for five years. This decision follows a three-year investigation into the financial activities of her charity, \"Fashion for Relief,\" which was found to have been \"poorly governed\" and lacking in \"adequate financial management.\"\\n\\nThe Charity Commission, which oversees charities in England and Wales, reported multiple instances of misconduct, revealing that only 8.5% of the charity\\'s expenditures went to charitable grants over a six-year period from 2016. Notably, the inquiry uncovered that charity funds were misused for Campbell\\'s luxury hotel stays during events in Cannes, alongside personal expenses such as spa treatments and room service.\\n\\nIn response to a question from the AP, Campbell said, \"I\\'ve just found out today about the findings and I am extremely concerned. We are investigating on our side. I was not in control of my charity; I put the control in the hands of a legal employer. We are investigating to find out what and how, and everything I do and every penny I ever raised goes to charity.\"\\n\\nAlongside Campbell, fellow trustee Bianka Hellmich has been disqualified for nine years after receiving unauthorized payments for consultancy services, while trustee Veronica Chou has been barred for four years. The charity, founded in 2005 to unite the fashion industry in addressing global poverty, was dissolved earlier this year, having raised over $15 million for various causes worldwide.\\n\\nDespite the controversy, Campbell\\'s honor in France highlights her lasting impact on the cultural landscape.\\n\\nRick Owens\\' enchants with gothic splendor\\n\\nAt Thursday\\'s show at the Palais de Tokyo, Rick Owens unleashed a captivating spectacle that felt like a dramatic descent into a realm inhabited by gothic aliens. The atmosphere was thick with smoke and suspense as an army of biblical figures marched out in impressive diagonal formations, their asymmetrical knee-high leather boots featuring translucent heels, making each step a statement.\\n\\nOwens\\' trademark angular, alien-like geometric shoulders dominated the runway, capturing the essence of his singular vision -- one that merges dark romanticism with avant-garde aesthetics. The collection was a testament to his ability to blend his gothic instincts with a sense of reverent irreverence, reminiscent of the \"delicate time\" he referenced in previous collections, where beauty and horror coexist.\\n\\nAs the show unfolded, a billowing coven emerged, clad in oversized black priest-like hoods and flowing tulle cloaks that draped elegantly over their forms. Some models donned discreet headscarves, striking a balance between reverence and defiance, perfectly embodying Owens\\' commentary on societal norms. This juxtaposition echoes his commitment to inclusivity, presenting a vision of fashion that celebrates diversity while challenging conventional beauty standards.\\n\\nThe intricate craftsmanship used in the collection exemplified Owens\\' mastery. Each piece, from the cloaks to the striking silhouettes, invited viewers to appreciate humble fabrics. This aligns with his insistence that he presents \"the most excellent aesthetics\" possible, recognizing the nuanced interplay between the dark and the light in our world.\\n\\nWhile some may find Owens\\' aesthetic too avant-garde or even gloomy, this show reaffirmed his position as a provocative force in fashion. The theatricality and elaborate design remind us of his role as one of the last independent designers in Paris, navigating the complexities of the fashion landscape with fierce authenticity.\\n\\nAssociated Press journalist Marine Lesprit contributed to this report\\n\\nThomas Adamson, The Associated Press', 'image': 'https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2024/09/6f72780ab54aec3b8d056b1e0dff82e4a13d2aa22407d25ebaad530008fbdb22.jpg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop', 'sentiment': 0.4823529411764707, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338879114', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:01:54Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T00:01:35Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.on3.com/teams/kentucky-wildcats/news/here-comes-the-boom-recaps-week-kentucky-recruiting/', 'title': 'Here Comes the Boom Recaps the Week in Recruiting with Updates on Upcoming Kentucky OVs', 'body': \"Here Comes the Boom is back for a short recap of the week's recruiting news.

X said it received more than 224 million user reports during the first six months of this year.\\n\\nIt\\'s the first time X has released a formal global transparency report since Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter in 2022. The company said last year it was reviewing how it approaches transparency reporting, but still released data about how many accounts and how much content were pulled down.\\n\\nSafety issues have long dogged the social media platform, which has faced criticism from advocacy groups, regulators and others that the company doesn\\'t do enough to moderate harmful content. But those fears heightened after Musk took over Twitter and laid off more than 6,000 people from the company.\\n\\nThe release of X\\'s transparency report also comes as advertisers plan to cut their spending on the platform next year and the company escalates its battle with regulators. This year, X\\'s chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, told US lawmakers the company was restructuring its trust and safety teams and is building a trust and safety center in Austin, Texas.\\n\\nMusk, who said last year that advertisers who were boycotting his platform could \"go (expletive) yourself,\" has also moderated his tone. At this year\\'s Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, he said that \"advertisers have a right to appear next to content that they find compatible with their brands.\"\\n\\nWhen Musk took over Twitter, several changes he made raised alarms among safety experts. X reinstated previously suspended accounts including those of white nationalists, stopped enforcing its policy against Covid-19 misinformation and abruptly disbanded its Trust and Safety Council, an advisory group that included human rights activists, child safety organizations and other experts.\\n\\nX has also grappled with scrutiny that it\\'s become less transparent under Musk\\'s leadership. The company, which was once publicly traded, became private after Musk purchased it for US$44bil (RM182bil).\\n\\nThe change meant that the social media platform no longer reported its quarterly user numbers and revenue publicly. Last year, X started charging for access to its data, making it tougher for researchers to conduct studies about the platform.\\n\\nConcerns about the lack of moderation on X has also posed a threat to its advertising business. The World Bank in September halted paid advertising on the platform after its ads showed up under a racist post. Roughly 25% of advertisers expect to decrease their spending on X next year and only 4% of advertisers think the platform\\'s ads provide brand safety, according to a survey by the market research firm Kantar.\\n\\nSome of the top problems that users reported on X involved posts that allegedly violated the platform\\'s rules on harassment, violent content and hateful conduct, the platform\\'s transparency report shows.\\n\\nMusk, who has called himself a \"free speech absolutist,\" has said on X that his approach to enforcing the platform\\'s rules is to restrict the reach of potentially offensive posts rather than taking down the posts. He also sued California last year over a state law that lawmakers say aims to make social networks more transparent because of free speech concerns.\\n\\nX\\'s transparency report shows that toughly 2.8 million accounts were suspended for violating the platform\\'s rules against child sexual exploitation, making up more than half of the 5.3 million accounts that were pulled down.\\n\\nBut the report also showed that X resorted to labeling user content in some cases rather than removing or suspending accounts.\\n\\nX applied 5.4 million labels to content reported for abuse, harassment and hateful conduct, relying heavily on automated technology. Roughly 2.2 million pieces of content were taken down for violating those rules.\\n\\nThe platform\\'s rules state that the site doesn\\'t allow media depicting hateful imagery such as the Nazi swastika in live videos, account bios, profiles or header images. Other instances, though, must be marked as sensitive media. This week, X also made changes to a feature that allows users to block people on the platform. People whom users have blocked will be able to see their posts but not engage with them.\\n\\nX also suspended nearly 464 million accounts for violating its rules against platform manipulation and spam. Musk vowed to \"defeat the spam bots\" on Twitter before he took over the platform. The company\\'s report also included a metric called the \"post violation rate\" that showed users are unlikely to come across content that breaks the site\\'s rules.\\n\\nMeanwhile, X continues to face legal challenges in several countries including Brazil, whose Supreme Court blocked the site because Musk failed to comply with court orders to suspend certain accounts for posting hate speech. The company bowed to legal demands this week in an attempt to get reinstated. It has also been reporting content moderation data to regulators in places such as Europe and India.\\n\\nThe report included the number of requests X gets from government and law enforcement agencies. The company received 18,737 government requests for user account information and it disclosed information in about 53% of these cases.\\n\\nTwitter started publicly reporting in 2012 the number of government requests it received for user information and content removal. The company\\'s first transparency report, which also included data about copyright takedown notices, came after Google started releasing this data in 2010.\\n\\nAfter revelations surfaced in 2013 that the National Security Agency had access to user data that Apple, Google, Facebook and other tech giants collected, a growing number of online platforms started to disclose more information about requests they received from the government and law enforcement. - Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service', 'image': 'https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/09/26/2932686.jpg', 'sentiment': -0.3254901960784313, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8338879215', 'is_duplicate': True, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-27T00:02:00Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T00:01:41Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://sports.yahoo.com/blackmon-shows-one-final-games-222606215.html', 'title': 'Blackmon drives in 3 runs in one of the last games of his career as Rockies beat Cardinals 10-8', 'body': 'DENVER (AP) -- Charlie Blackmon had three RBIs and three runs in one of the final games of his professional career, Michael Toglia had three hits and two RBIs, and the Colorado Rockies avoided a sweep with a come-from-behind 10-8 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday.\\n\\nA two-run, game-tying double from Ezequiel Tovar was the catalyst of a five-run eighth inning for the Rockies, who had lost five of their previous six games.
