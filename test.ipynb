As of July 21, 2024, \\\"there were 662,566 noncitizens with criminal histories on ICE's national docket, which includes those detained by ICE, and on the agency's non-detained docket. Of those, 435,719 are convicted criminals, and 226,847 have pending criminal charges,\\\" ICE Deputy Director Patrick Lechleitner said.\\n\\nThis includes criminal foreign nationals convicted of, or charged with, homicide (14,914), sexual assault (20,061), assault (105,146), kidnapping (3,372), and commercialized sexual offenses, including sex trafficking (3,971).\\n\\nAn additional 60,268 are on the list for burglary/larceny/robbery; 126,343 for traffic offenses including driving under the influence (DUIs) and 16,820 for weapons offenses.\\n\\nICE's national docket refers to illegal foreign nationals who were apprehended by Border Patrol agents who then turn them over to ICE. Despite having a confirmed documented criminal history, ICE released them into the United States.\\n\\nLechleitner notes that some local jurisdictions \\\"have reduced their cooperation with ICE, to include refusal to honor ICE detainer requests, even for noncitizens who have been convicted of serious felonies and pose an ongoing threat to public safety\\\" due to their so-called \\\"sanctuary city\\\" policies. \\\"However, 'sanctuary' policies can end up shielding dangerous criminals, who often victimize those same communities,\\\" he said.\\n\\nBecause of local jurisdictions refusing to cooperate with ICE, the agency lifted detainers for 24,796 known criminals and released them into the U.S., he said. The data is from Oct. 1, 2020, through July 22, 2024.\\n\\nAmong them, state and local law enforcement agencies refused to comply with 23,591 detainer requests; 1,205 detainer requests were lifted \\\"due to insufficient notice to ICE.\\\"\\n\\nAlso during this period, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations issued 2,897 detainers that were declined by state or local law enforcement agencies even after the subject of the detainer request had a subsequent apprehension by ICE ERO, according to the report.\\n\\nMore from this section Plane contrails: white fluffy contributors to global warming Kenya set for full Haiti deployment amid call for shift to UN mission Swiss central bank cuts rate again amid strong franc worries\\n\\nLechleitner also notes that \\\"most noncitizens who are convicted of homicide are typically not eligible for release from ICE custody under ยง236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\\\" but \\\"ICE officers may use their discretion in making custody determinations and release noncitizens with conditions.\\\" He says these determinations are made on a \\\"case-by-case basis.\\\"\\n\\nIn response, U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green, R-TN, said, \\\"It may be shocking to hear that the Biden-Harris administration is actively releasing tens of thousands of criminal illegal aliens into our communities, but their own numbers conclusively prove this to be the case.\\n\\n\\\"This defies all common sense. Under President Biden and his 'border czar,' Vice President Harris, DHS law enforcement has been directed to mass-release illegal aliens whom they know have criminal convictions or are facing charges for serious crimes - and these dangerous, destructive individuals are making their way into every city and state in this country. How many more Americans need to die or be victimized before this administration is forced to abide by the laws they swore to uphold?\\n\\n\\\"This is madness. It is something no civilized, well-functioning society should tolerate.\\\"\\n\\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said the number was \\\"shocking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If accurate, it means that almost 10%\\\" of the criminal illegal foreign nationals released into the country by the Biden-Harris administration \\\"are criminals. It also debunks the narrative that illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crime. We can't survive four more years of this.\\\"\\n\\nMore than 387,000 criminal noncitizens were arrested by ICE ERO agents in fiscal years 2021 through 2023, The Center Square first reported.\\n\\nThe majority arrested were citizens of Mexico, Nicaragua, Columbia and Venezuela.\\n\\nThe majority of arrests occurred in Dallas and Houston, Texas, according to an ICE online statistical dashboard. The most common arrests are of those convicted of DUIs, drug possession, and assault and criminal (non-civil) traffic offenses like hit-and-run or leaving the scene of an accident, ICE says.\\n\\nAdditionally, a separate data point shows that U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol apprehensions of criminal noncitizens totaled nearly 54,000 since fiscal 2021, according to CBP data as of Sept. 16. The majority were for illegal entry and reentry and DUIs.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"reformer.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Brattleboro Reformer\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"bethany_blankley@reformer.com\",\"name\":\"Bethany Blankley\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime/Research\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Crime/Research\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Politics\",\"label\":\"news/Politics\",\"wgt\":96}],\"image\":\"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reformer.com/content/tncms/custom/image/bd63a06c-429a-11ee-8950-d704275f5abb.png?resize=600%2C315\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9944900\",\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":-0.5607843137254902,\"wgt\":465177600,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340397475\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:00:05\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:05Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T23:59:24Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.news-gazette.com/angel-reese-accepting-villain-role-for-good-of-womens-basketball-backfired-on-me/article_06c03571-015c-5cb8-acdc-4f9501cd3d81.html\",\"title\":\"Angel Reese: Accepting 'villain' role for good of women's basketball 'backfired on me'\",\"body\":\"Angel Reese said earlier this year she is willing to \\\"take the villain role\\\" in the interest of \\\"growing women's basketball.\\\"\\n\\nNow, however, the Chicago Sky star feels that approach has \\\"backfired on me.\\\"\\n\\nThe WNBA released a statement Wednesday night saying it \\\"will not tolerate racist, derogatory, or threatening comments\\\" toward anyone affiliated with the league, after being called out by Connecticut Sun star Alyssa Thomas about hate speech directed toward her and other players on social media.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Reese started a series of posts on X that seemed to address the media's coverage of the matter.\\n\\n\\\"Y'all know i've been going through this for the last 2 years but was told 'save the tears' & 'stop playing victim,'\\\" Reese wrote. \\\"Y'all a little late to the party and could have tried to put out this fire way before it started.\\\"\\n\\nIn a second post, Reese wrote: \\\"I've never in my life had privilege but I definitely know the power I have through my platform. That didn't come overnight. I grew that on my OWN. With that being said, I will continue to use my voice in the right way & say what's right even though it has backfired on me to be this 'villain'. I won't stop!!\\\"\\n\\nReese continued in a third post.\\n\\n\\\"For the past 2 years, the media has benefited from my pain & me being villainized to create a narrative. They allowed this. This was beneficial to them,\\\" she wrote. \\\"I sometimes share my experiences of things that have happened to me but I've also allowed this to happen to me for way too long and now other players in this league are dealing with & experiencing the same things.\\n\\n\\\"This isn't ok at all. Anything beyond criticism about playing the game we love is wrong. I'm sorry to all the players that have/continue to experience the same things I have.... This is why I started my podcast. To take my voice back and create the narrative of who I really am. At the end of the day, I don't want an apology nor do I think this will ever stop but something has to change.\\\"\\n\\nAs a star player at Louisiana State, Reese developed an on-court rivalry with then-Iowa star Caitlin Clark, now with the Indiana Fever. In April, Reese talked about the trash talk that went both ways between her and Clark, including the gesture Reese made toward the Hawkeyes standout during the 2023 national championship game that received widespread attention.\\n\\n\\\"That's fine. I'll take the villain role,\\\" Reese said. \\\"I'll take the hit for it, but I know we're growing women's basketball. If this is the way we're going to do it, then this is the way we're going to do it. You either like it or you don't.\\\"\\n\\nReese expressed a similar sentiment in June, as she and Clark were in the midst of celebrated rookie seasons that helped the WNBA's popularity soar.\\n\\n\\\"Look where women's basketball is. People are talking about women's basketball that you never would think would be talking about women's basketball. People are pulling up to games, we got celebrities coming to games, sold out arenas, like just because of one single game,\\\" Reese said, referring to the 2023 championship game.\\n\\n\\\"And just looking at that, I'll take that role. I'll take the bad guy role, and I'll continue to take that on and be that for my teammates. And if I want to be that and I know I'll go down in history, I'll look back in 20 years and be like, yeah, the reason why we watching women's basketball is not just because of one person. It's because of me too, and I want you all to realize that.\\\"\\n\\nAlso on Friday, the Women's National Basketball Players Association released a statement calling for more integrity and professionalism in the way the league is covered by the media.\\n\\n\\\"Instead of demonstrating the cornerstones of journalism ethics like integrity, objectivity, and a commitment to truth, you have chosen to be indecent and downright insincere,\\\" the union said in a statement that is addressed \\\"to unprofessional members of the media like Christine Brennan.\\\"\\n\\nBrennan, a USA Today columnist, has not responded to the statement on her social media accounts. USA Today Sports posted a statement on X from executive editor Roxanna Scott in support of Brennan.\\n\\n\\\"Christine Brennan is well regarded as an advocate for women and athletes, but first and foremost, she's a journalist,\\\" Scott wrote.\\n\\nยฉ2024 Los Angeles Times.

A jury trial is scheduled for February.\\n\\n* Douglas Endorf, 50, of Centerville, was granted a suspended imposition of sentence for his third offense driving under the influence (DUI) charge in 2022. Judge Chris Giles noted that he typically doesn't offer such leniency in felony DUI cases. However, the judge made an exception for Endorf, citing his optimism about the defendant's progress towards rehabilitation.\\n\\n* Heath Kroeze, 22, of Orange City, Iowa, pleaded guilty to a first offense driving under the influence (DUI) charge with a blood alcohol content of 0.08% or more, classified as a Class 1 misdemeanor. According to court documents, Kroeze was driving at speeds over 100 mph with a blood alcohol content of 0.178 -- more than twice the legal limit -- when he side-swiped a semi-truck. As part of his sentence, Kroeze was fined $500 and ordered to serve three days in jail, with credit for one day already served. He has also completed a Mothers Against Drunk Driving course. The plea agreement led to the dismissal of three additional Class 1 misdemeanor charges: failure to stop at an accident causing property damage, reckless driving, and a separate first offense DUI charge.

A previously scheduled October jury trial was postponed to December.\\n\\n* Carlos Espinosa Vargas, 60, of Mitchell, pleaded guilty to a second-offense DUI and hit and run, both Class 1 misdemeanors. Sentencing was postponed to allow the State's Attorney time to determine restitution amounts for two vehicles damaged in the hit and run accident.

They recently defeated the Cincinnati Bengals on the road during primetime behind a strong Jayden Daniels performance.\\n\\nThe rookie quarterback will be short of some help on Sunday, though.

Cosmi was added to the report this week, and as Washington's best offensive lineman, his absence would have certainly hurt the offense.\\n\\nThe Commanders will be without Ekeler and Crowder, but they've still got weapons and Daniels leading the way, so they should be able to rival the Cardinals well on Sunday after a somewhat hot start to the season.\\n\\nFor the Cardinals, Trey McBride and Khyiris Tonga were listed out for the game, with Kelvin Bachum and Isaiah Adams being given a questionable status.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"si.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Sports Illustrated\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":99}],\"image\":\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4687,h_2636,x_1418,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/commander_country/01j8ty2dnm8b1kn4h65f.jpg\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.05882352941176472,\"wgt\":465177616,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340397474\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:00:21\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:21Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T23:59:24Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.772549033164978,\"url\":\"https://www.news-gazette.com/dylan-hern-ndez-dodgers-star-shohei-ohtani-proves-no-moment-is-too-big-for-him/article_36b7df86-567f-5dd1-88e5-79b4d84deeda.html\",\"title\":\"Dylan Hernรกndez: Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani proves no moment is too big for him\",\"body\":\"LOS ANGELES -- Shohei Ohtani isn't like any other baseball player.\\n\\nThis isn't about him being a two-way player when healthy or his combination of power and speed that produced the sport's first 50-homer, 50-steal season.\\n\\nThis is about how he deals with career-defining moments.\\n\\nWhat's at stake for his team. The implications for his legacy. The tens of thousands of people watching in person, and the millions more watching around the world. The responsibility of projecting the virtues of an entire culture.\\n\\nOther players make an effort to block out such thoughts or use them as fuel to elevate their adrenaline levels. Ohtani called them \\\"ingredients to heighten focus.\\\"\\n\\nReflecting on his seventh-inning single that drove in the go-ahead run in a 7-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on Thursday that secured the Dodgers their most recent division title, Ohtani described himself as being in a trance-like state.\\n\\n\\\"I was too focused to where I didn't really think about being nervous,\\\" he said in Japanese.\\n\\nNotice what Ohtani said. He wasn't just focused. He was too focused.\\n\\nWhatever he was feeling or thinking, the result was predictable. With two men on base and one out, Ohtani singled to right field against left-handed reliever Tanner Scott to drive in Kikรฉ Hernรกndez and move the Dodgers in front, 3-2.\\n\\n\\\"Really, I only thought about getting a hit,\\\" Ohtani said.\\n\\nOhtani also drove in the deciding run the previous day in a 4-3 win over the Padres in which a loss would have diminished the Dodgers' lead over their second-place rivals to a single game. By virtue of their head-to-head record, the Padres held the tiebreaker over the Dodgers, which means they would have won the division if they finished with the same regular-season record.\\n\\n\\\"No moment ever seems too big for him,\\\" third baseman Max Muncy said. \\\"When he steps in the box, you feel he's going to do something special. I say it all the time: He doesn't disappoint. He's incredible.\\\"\\n\\nWhich is why the Dodgers can't be counted out in October. Finally, in his seventh major league season, Ohtani will perform for the first time on the postseason stage.\\n\\nThe Dodgers don't have the pitching typically required to win a World Series. This alone would eliminate most teams from being serious championship contenders, but how can any team with Ohtani not be a serious contender?\\n\\n\\\"I think there are some people that when the moment gets big they run from it,\\\" manager Dave Roberts said. \\\"Other guys embrace it and Shohei has embraced these moments better than any player I've ever been around.\\\"\\n\\nIn a sport in which exerting greater effort often produces worse results, Ohtani practically hits on command.\\n\\nThat's what he did on Sunday in a comeback win over the Colorado Rockies. The Dodgers were three outs away from their lead over the Padres being reduced to two games when Ohtani led off the ninth inning with a tying home run. Mookie Betts hit a walk-off homer in the next at-bat.\\n\\nThat's also what Ohtani did last year when playing for Japan in the World Baseball Classic. His team trailing Mexico in the ninth inning of their semifinal game, Ohtani started the comeback with a leadoff double.\\n\\n\\\"I had decided I was going to get on base no matter what,\\\" Ohtani said, as if that was a choice.\\n\\nJapan went on to win the tournament.\\n\\n\\\"You can obviously see how much he cares about winning,\\\" left-hander Clayton Kershaw said. \\\"It's really fun to see the energy, especially in bigger games that we've seen recently. He really, really wants to [win] and gets excited about the possibility of postseason stuff, which is awesome.\\\"\\n\\nOver the course of this season, Kershaw was offered a behind-the-scenes view of how Ohtani created his on-field magic.\\n\\n\\\"Just from watching him, I appreciate how diligent he is,\\\" Kershaw said. \\\"He doesn't ever look or say or feel like he's tired. Every day is the same. He does his rehab. He does his warmup, his workout, he hits, he does his stuff, steals bases, hits homers and the next day is the exact same. I just appreciate consistency. I appreciate an attention to detail and a diligence. He does that. He does that really, really well, better than most.\\\"\\n\\nWhen closer Michael Kopech forced Kyle Higashioka to pop up for the final out Thursday night, Ohtani momentarily let his guard down.\\n\\nHe laughed in the clubhouse as his teammates doused him in cheap sparkling wine and beer. He emptied a bottle of Budweiser on the head of Yoshinobu Yamamoto and poured another down his back.\\n\\n\\\"It was the best,\\\" Ohtani said. \\\"I'd like to do my best so I can do it again and again.\\\"\\n\\nThe only other time Ohtani dumped alcohol on teammates in the wake of a season-long achievement like this, he was a 22-year-old player on the Nippon-Ham Fighters.\\n\\nThat celebration was nothing like this one.\\n\\nNot wanting to soak locker room carpets with alcohol, Japanese baseball teams stage their clinching parties off site, usually a couple of hours after the final pitch. Only beer is used, no Champagne or sparkling wine. In the case of the 2016 Fighters, they celebrated their victory in the Japan Series in an underground parking lot of a Hiroshima hotel.\\n\\nThe next day, one the country's major sports newspapers featured a picture of Ohtani with goggles on his forehead, emptying a bottle of Sapporo on a teammate's head. Literally and figuratively, he towered over everyone around him.\\n\\nEight years later, in the world's most competitive baseball league, Ohtani once again towers over his contemporaries. He figures to increase in stature in the coming weeks. The playoffs are starting.\\n\\nยฉ2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com.

I certainly know a lot of the people over there, I know a lot of the players over there, but I think there's been enough distance at this point.\\\"\\n\\nStearns joined the Brewers in October 2015 as general manager and was promoted to president of baseball operations before the 2019 season. He stepped down after the 2022 season and remained with the Brewers in an advisory role while Matt Arnold -- his former right-hand man -- took over as president of baseball operations. Stearns left Milwaukee entirely last fall to run baseball operations for the team he rooted for as a kid growing up in New York City.\\n\\nHe believed this was his first time back at American Family Field since August 2023. The Brewers opened the season by sweeping the Mets in New York, but the teams hadn't faced each other since.\\n\\nNow they're meeting again with the Mets' season on the line. New York entered Friday just ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks for the second of three National League wild cards, with the Atlanta Braves one game behind both.\\n\\nAs Stearns noted, the Brewers' roster has changed quite a bit since he departed. Milwaukee's starting lineup Friday included only four players -- second baseman Brice Turang, right fielder Sal Frelick, left fielder Jackson Chourio and shortstop Willy Adames -- who joined the organization when Stearns was in charge.\\n\\nEven so, Stearns played a major role in helping the Brewers put together the longest sustained run of success in franchise history. Milwaukee clinched the NL Central title last week and will be making its sixth playoff appearance in the last seven years. That run of postseason bids came shortly after Stearns engineered the blockbuster acquisition of Christian Yelich, the 2018 NL MVP.\\n\\nMilwaukee had made the playoffs just twice in a 35-year stretch from 1983-2017.\\n\\n\\\"It's fun being back here,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"I'm glad I'm back here when games really matter for us. We're playing for something that's really important, so we have to go out and have a good series.\\\"\\n\\nStearns is now trying to get back in the playoffs with the Mets, which could result in a return to Milwaukee next month. But that path just got quite a bit more complicated.\\n\\nThe Mets face the possibility of playing a doubleheader in Atlanta on Monday -- the day after the scheduled end of the regular season -- for the right to begin a Wild Card Series on Tuesday. That scenario developed because New York's scheduled Wednesday and Thursday games in Atlanta were rained out.\\n\\n\\\"Nobody wants to play a doubleheader on Monday,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"The Braves didn't want that outcome, MLB didn't want that outcome and certainly we didn't want that outcome.

The International team returned the favor on a loud and raucous Friday at Royal Montreal by sweeping the foursomes matches and tied the Presidents Cup at 5-all. The Americans swept the opening session. This shutout by the Internationals was even more dominant. Three of the matches ended at the 14th hole or sooner. Hideki Matsuyama and Sungjae Im tied a Presidents Cup record for biggest margin with a 7-and-6 win over Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele. They ended that match with seven straight birdies, unusual for alternate shot.\\n\\nAttorney for 18-year-old trying to halt auction of Ohtani's 50/50 ball confident he has strong case\\n\\nMIAMI (AP) -- The attorney for an 18-year-old man trying to stop Shohei Ohtani's 50th home run ball from being sold at auction until a lawsuit is resolved believes he has a strong case. Online bidding on the ball began Friday, less than 24 hours after a Miami-Dade County judge said the process could begin. However, a sale can't be finalized before the judge rules on a motion for a temporary injunction next month. The lawsuit claims that Max Matus gained possession of the ball Ohtani hit for his 50th home run on Sept. 19 before another man, Chris Belanski, took it away. Matus was celebrating his 18th birthday at LoanDepot Park.\\n\\nCowboys could be without injured Parsons, Lawrence for multiple games, AP sources say\\n\\nDALLAS (AP) -- Two people with knowledge of the injuries say two-time All-Pro Micah Parsons and fellow pass rusher DeMarcus Lawrence could miss multiple games for the Dallas Cowboys after getting hurt in a victory over the New York Giants. Parsons has a high ankle sprain and Lawrence a foot sprain. Parsons is considered week to week while Lawrence could be out longer but is still being evaluated. Parsons and Lawrence are the club's two most accomplished pass rushers.\\n\\nApp State cancels football game against Liberty in North Carolina after Helene causes flooding\\n\\nAppalachian State's home football game against Liberty in Boone, North Carolina, scheduled for Saturday was canceled because of the impacts of severe weather on the area from Tropical Storm Helene.

Elsewhere, the Nashville Predators postponed their home preseason NHL game against the Tampa Bay Lightning scheduled for Friday night because of severe weather.\\n\\nNationals GM Mike Rizzo says long-term view of CJ Abrams is unchanged despite demotion\\n\\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo says his long-term view of CJ Abrams has not changed after the team's decision to demote the All-Star shortstop last week. Abrams was optioned to Triple-A Rochester on Saturday for the final nine days of the regular season for what the team described as an internal matter. The 23-year-old reported to Washington's training complex in West Palm Beach, Florida, this week. Abrams hit .246 with 20 homers, 65 RBIs and 31 steals in 138 games this season, earning his first All-Star selection in July.\\n\\nLindor returns to Mets' lineup after missing nearly 2 weeks with lower back pain\\n\\nMILWAUKEE (AP) -- Francisco Lindor is back in the New York Mets' lineup. And the team is confident he's feeling good enough to stay there the rest of the regular season. Lindor was leading off and playing shortstop Friday night at NL Central champion Milwaukee. The star switch-hitter and NL MVP contender hadn't played since Sept. 15 due to lower back pain. The Mets began a three-game series in Milwaukee on Friday and face the prospect of playing a Monday doubleheader in Atlanta if the National League playoff picture isn't cleared up by then. The Mets are optimistic Lindor could play those last five games in a four-day stretch if that scenario arises.\\n\\nTrevor Bauer is honored as pitcher of the year in the Mexican Baseball League\\n\\nMEXICO CITY (AP) -- Trevor Bauer has been honored as pitcher of the year in the Mexican Baseball League.. Bauer went 10-0 with a 2.48 ERA in 14 starts. He led the league in strikeouts with 120 in 83 1/3 innings. He also set a league record with 19 strikeouts in a nine-inning game and tied a record by striking out nine consecutive batters. Bauer won the 2020 National League Cy Young Award. He has been trying to to revive his big-league career after serving a 194-game suspension for violating MLB's domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy. He was never charged with a crime in the matter.\\n\\nSwiss teenage cyclist Muriel Furrer has died after crashing at the road world champs\\n\\nZURICH (AP) -- Swiss 18-year-old cyclist Muriel Furrer has died one day after sustaining a head injury in a crash at the road world championships. Race organizers say in a statement on Friday that \\\"Muriel Furrer sadly passed away today at Zurich University Hospital.\\\" Furrer was competing in the junior women's event on rain-slicked roads Thursday morning when she crashed in a forest area south of Zurich. She was airlifted by helicopter to the hospital.\\n\\nMan City's Rodri will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery\\n\\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) -- Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says midfielder Rodri has sustained ACL damage and will be out for the rest of the season. The Spain international has also injured his meniscus and underwent surgery on Friday. Rodri injured his right knee on Sunday in the first half of City's 2-2 draw against Arsenal.

Andretti in early 2023 confirmed he'd sold part of the company to Towriss, who is the owner of Gainbridge and holding company Group 1001. Gainbridge is one of the largest sponsors in IndyCar and also sponsors Andretti driver Colton Herta's car. The team has rapidly expanded with Towriss' influx of cash, and Towriss has been part of Andretti's push to join Formula 1.

Go ahead and Subscribe here.\\n\\nFollowing a power surge of backlash upon banning multi-plug outlets, Royal Caribbean has further clarified just exactly what type of these outlets are not permitted onboard their fleet.\\n\\nThe initial change was first noticed earlier this month when the cruise line had added multi-plug outlets to its prohibited items list, along with extension cords and power strips.\\n\\nMany cruise guests bring along these cube-style plug expanders as a way to ensure enough outlet space for charging multiple devices, plugging in CPAP machines, using hair styling tools, and otherwise giving all of their electronics ample room to connect to power.\\n\\nWhen the multi-plug outlets were first spotted on the prohibited items list, however, guest outcry was as fast as an electrical shock because of today's increasing need for more outlets, especially on older ships where staterooms may only have 1-2 outlets available.\\n\\nRoyal Caribbean has further updated the prohibited items list, however, to specify one type of multi-plug outlet that is, in fact, permitted - the kind that is used as a USB charger with multiple USB outlets to connect more than one device to the same outlet.\\n\\n\\\"We do allow consumer type power conversion device USB charger (multi-plug blocks on which the outputs are for USB cables),\\\" the prohibited items list now reads.\\n\\nThis accommodation will permit travelers to use these cubes - often called USB splitters or USB hubs - to charge phones, tablets, laptops, smartwatches, and more all at once, keeping everyone connected and powered up as much as they want on their cruise vacation.\\n\\nCubes come in different styles that may feature a different number of USB outlets or USB types to work with an array of different devices or to recharge at different speeds. Some designs also permit the use of a regular plug at the same time, further ensuring that the power supply can be fully used, though those adaptations may not be fully permitted.\\n\\nCruise travelers should note that Royal Caribbean requires that any power cubes brought on board \\\"must be stamped with US/Europe recognized Conformance Marking to demonstrate compliance with Electrical Safety standards.\\\"\\n\\nRead Also: Things You Can't Take on a Cruise\\n\\nThe entire reasoning for the electrical extension cord and surge protector ban is to safeguard the ship's electrical system and minimize the risk of fire, so this requirement does make sense.\\n\\nUSB charger cubes are relatively inexpensive, often available in simple designs for less than $10 depending on how many charging ports are featured and what other design amenities, such as foldable prongs, are part of the product.\\n\\nCruise lines all reserve the right to prohibit a variety of items from being brought onboard their ships. Many items on the prohibited lists make sense, such as weaponry, illegal drugs, or potentially flammable chemicals.\\n\\nOther items, however, are often related to the safety of the ship, such as radios and laser pointers, which can potentially cause problems with navigation or safety alert systems.\\n\\nSome items may just seem odd - like hammers, cattle prods, and surf boards - but each one does have some logic behind it, even if most cruise travelers can't quite imagine packing along such items in the first place.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the prohibited list, Royal Caribbean does note that the list is not necessary comprehensive and may be subject to change at any time or even on individual sailings.\\n\\n\\\"Some items that are not specifically on the list may be prohibited if they are deemed questionable by the Staff Captain and Security Officer,\\\" the notification reads.\\n\\nBefore setting sail with any cruise line, travelers should always check the associated prohibited items list to be sure they are in compliance with the guidelines and do not have any items confiscated as they try to board their cruise ship.\\n\\nHave you ever had an item confiscated on a cruise?

It's a sparkling melting pot of Southeast Asian culture, brimming with an ever-expanding arsenal of headline experiences. But alongside ticking off the likes of Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands, the Lion City's biggest roar is reserved for the sizzling street food scene spilling forth in the hawker centre. Singapore's harmonious multiculturalism and all its culinary influences positively sing on the plate. Come nightfall, Lau Pa Sat in downtown Singapore transforms into Satay Street, where a riot of meat on skewers and peanut sauce hold court.\\n\\nIn the interests of food hygiene, the vast majority street food stalls were kicked off the kerbside and directed indoors in the 1970s, giving birth to Singapore's legendary hawker stall culture. At last count there's now 110 hawker centres, of various sizes, pepper-potting Singapore. And they maintain a rigorous cleaning culture, where each centre closes down every three months for a 48-hour deep clean.\\n\\nHawker Food culture in Singapore. Photo / Supplied\\n\\nSingapore is also famous for being one of the few countries in the world to have its street food featured in the annually released Michelin Guide. Michelin stars generally aren't awarded to the hawker stalls because it's deemed unfair to the pricier restaurant scene given their higher operating costs. However Michelin inspectors consider the hawker cuisine so good, they award stand-out vendors with a Michelin Guide recommendation or Bib Gourmand award, which recognises high-quality, low-price food. So if you want to eat your way through Singapore, what are the must-try signature dishes and where should you head?\\n\\nUnofficially regarded as Singapore's national food, Hainanese Chicken Rice is a dish of sliced tender chicken served with fragrant rice, ginger paste and a spicy chilli sauce. Adapted from the early Chinese immigrants from Hainan Island, it's the spices and sauces used, which give the dish a unique, lingering, and lip-smacking taste. Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown is home to a Michelin Bib Gourmand recipient for its Hainanese Chicken Rice - the Tian Tian hawker stall. They serve their main dish with a side of vegetables in oyster sauce. Superb!\\n\\nTian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. Photo / Mike Yardley\\n\\nChar Kway Teow, which translates to 'fried flat rice noodles', is one of the most celebrated street foods in Singapore. It is a noodle dish made with variations of shrimps, eggs, Chinese sausage, pork lard, cockles, bean sprouts, and chives - all fried and dipped in soy sauce. The heart of this dish is lard which makes it super delicious. It is often served on a banana leaf to enhance the fragrance with a wedge of lime squeezed on the top. The Hong Lim Complex in Outram Park is one of the best places to sample this dish, because the Char Kway Teow hawker stall also proudly sports a Michelin Bib Gourmand. Queues can be formidable, but it's worth the wait.\\n\\nNative to the local cuisine, Singaporean Chilli Crab is a stir-fried crustacean dish prepared with sweet and spicy tomato sauces, mostly served with deep-fried steam buns called Mantou. Part of the primal joy of tucking into a heaping platter of chilli crab is just how messy it is to eat. Some vendors even provide plastic gloves for an easier cleanup. This Singapore staple is a must-try for seafood enthusiasts.\\n\\nA must-try traditional Peranakan dish, also synonymous with Malaysia, is Laksa - a sweet and spicy soup of rice vermicelli noodles, cooked in a creamy sauce made from coconut milk and curry-based broth. Its spice comes from other ingredients including turmeric, coriander, and galangal. It is usually served with bean curd puff, cockles, fish cakes, or bean sprouts. When it comes to global comfort foods, a lusciously creamy bowl of noodles has to rank right near the top.\\n\\nSambal Stingray is another street food classic. Sambal is a special sauce made from chilli peppers, shrimp, fish sauce, shallot, sugar, vinegar and ginger. Combined with the soft, delicate and distinctive stingray meat, the palate is exquisite. This dish tastes best barbequed, wrapped in banana leaves. Malay culture conceived this popular street food of Singapore after discovering what a winning pairing that Sambal on top of Stingray is.\\n\\nLiterally meaning 'Meat bone tea', Bak Kut Teh is like a cherished all-day breakfast in Singapore. This local dish is a pork rib soup, in a broth of herbs and spices. Comprising of pork, offal, mushroom, choy sum, tofu and puffs, the soup is spiced up with cinnamon, cloves, garlic, fennel and star anise. This dish is relished with tea in the belief that tea will help saturate a large amount of fat in the soup. I've just tried Bak Hut Teh for the first time and I'm sold! The peppery, pork rib broth simmers for hours, developing a profound depth of flavour in the process and the meat is so tender. The dish has its roots in Singapore's Teochew community, a group that immigrated from southern China. Ng Ah Sio Pork Ribs Soup Eating House, just off Clarke Quay, has been a Singapore go-to for half a century.\\n\\nA cheap and cheerful breakfast staple is Kaya Toast. The toast is coated in this lusciously sweet jam, made with coconut, sugar, and eggs. The mixture is cooked down until thick, rich, and lightly caramelised. Pandan leaves are what give this spread both its fragrance and distinctive green colour. To the uninitiated, pandan smells vaguely reminiscent of vanilla mixed with pine.\\n\\nSnacks and pick me ups? Curry puffs are a marvel. Similar to a small pie or samosa, the flaky puff pastry is typically filled with chicken, curry, potato and egg. Fillings vary from vendor to vendor, so graze widely. When you're feasting at Maxwell, don't miss the Fuzhou Oyster Cake stall. Established 60 years ago by Madam Pang, the family-run business specialises in these tasty morsels, which Michelin raves about.\\n\\nTanglin Crispy Curry Puff. Photo / Mike Yardley\\n\\nI'm also a devotee of Roti Tisu, or tissue bread. Made from the same dough used in Roti flatbread, it is then stretched to a translucent, paper-thin thickness, before being placed on the pan to fry with condensed milk. Head to any coffee shop in Little India and whistle up a sweet Roti Tisu. Served on a plate like a giant conical hat, it's a statement snack.\\n\\nShaped like a UFO, the Fuzhou Oyster Cake consists of a rice-based fried batter encasing moist minced meat, chopped oysters, crunchy peanuts, and coriander. Fried in small batches to ensure freshness, resulting in both chewy and crispy textures. Spectacular! If you're familiar with Hawai'i's famed Dole Whip, pineapple lovers rejoice! I must give a shout-out to McDonalds Singapore who pump out Pineapple Soft Serve in a cone for just $1.20. It's nearly as good as the Hawaiian classic, and a trusty rejuvenator when that sultry Singapore heat starts to get the better of you!\\n\\nMaxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cakes. Photo / Klook\\n\\nI discovered many of Singapore's best hawker stalls, local favourites and heritage heroes, thanks to my Go City Singapore Explorer Pass. The pass features a starring array of indelible city experiences, but the food tours on foot are particularly good. There's even a food tour which is focused on Michelin recommended hawker stalls. You'll save up to 50% on all the sights and attractions with a Go City pass in over 25 destinations. To check out all available Go City experiences, and a pass to sui, head to https://gocity.com\\n\\nI jetted my way to Singapore with the award-winning flag-carrier, Singapore Airlines. All of my flights ran to time, all checked bags were faithfully waiting for me on the carousel and the in-flight experience was impeccable. The illustrious full-service carrier has not only fostered a world-beating reputation for its exceptional customer service and in-flight product, but also its innovation, across all classes. You'd struggle to find a better Economy class experience in the skies, but if you're wondering if Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines is worth upgrading to, you're absolutely in for a treat.\\n\\nI experienced the cabin on their A350-900 aircraft, which is a daily fixture on their Auckland and Christchurch services to Singapore. Premium Economy is an increasingly enticing option for Kiwis flying long-haul and hankering for affordable space and extra-comfort.\\n\\nA350 Premium Economy. Photo / Supplied\\n\\nI enjoyed priority handling and boarding, before kicking back in my comfy cabin, where the seating is arranged in a 2-4-2 seating arrangement - ideal if you're travelling as a couple. The enhanced sense of spaciousness is readily apparent with greater seat width of 49.5 centimetres including a calf-rest and footrest, 96cms seat pitch and 20cms of sweet sleep-inducing recline. It's striking how just a little bit more space and recline can make a world of difference.\\n\\nCharles de Cazanove Brut Champagne freely flowed throughout the cabin, as did the Singapore Slings. Don't mind if I do! The in-flight dining service features an exquisite menu that includes dishes created by the Airline's International Culinary Panel, with gourmet dining for Premium Economy guests, including the extensive pre-flight Book the Cook menu. I noshed on a fabulous Chicken Breast with mushroom cream sauce, while the Fruit Crumble with Anglaise sauce was a delightful dessert.\\n\\nYou'll enjoy individual in-seat power supply, two USB ports, personal in-seat reading light, cocktail table, and additional stowage space for personal items. The KrisWorld entertainment system brims with over 1000 movie, TV, music and gaming selections, plus live news and sport. Equipped with noise cancelling headphones, the high-definition touch screen monitors are supersized at 33cms, from which I devoured so much content. The in-flight WiFi worked a trick too - complimentary for KrisFlyer members.

They played an integral role in bringing life to Mitchell's Creative Way, a new art alley between Main Street and Lawler Street that officially opened Friday, Sept. 27, 2024. It's located just west of Wells Fargo bank and is modeled after an\\n\\nart alley in Rapid City that has been around for more than 20 years.\\n\\n\\\"If we can find a good spot, let's do it,\\\" said Schwalm, explaining that Sherwood brought the idea to the Mitchell Area Council of the Arts when he joined the five-person board.\\n\\nAnd they did, thanks in large part to Sherwood -- whom Schwalm called \\\"the catalyst of the whole project.\\\"\\n\\nHe already has quite an impact on Mitchell's downtown through window art and murals on Main Street businesses, including a large painting on the side of Main Street Mercantile.\\n\\nIt was more than 10 years ago when he painted in Rapid City's art alley, a piece that highlighted his son Logan's name and birthday. When his son turned 6, Stan and Logan returned to let Logan make his impression painting at the Rapid City art alley.\\n\\nNow that idea and opportunity has come to Mitchell.\\n\\nSherwood said the hope is for young artists who don't know how to get seen publicly, or perhaps shy, to utilize the wall.\\n\\n\\\"They can come down here any time of the day, once they get a permit, and just do it,\\\" Sherwood said Friday. \\\"They don't have to take credit, but inside they'll know they did it.\\\"\\n\\nIt's important to note artists must obtain a free permit to paint, but it's a minor hurdle to ensure whatever is created will be business-friendly, Schwalm said. To get a permit, anyone needs to check in with the Mitchell Area Council of the Arts, either by talking to one of the board members or by\\n\\napplying online at the organization's website.\\n\\nSherwood said two permits were filled out before the alleyway was even officially opened, and other artists have inquired about doing the same.\\n\\nThe flat, white wall on the east side of the alley is a low, accessible spot for painting. To the west is another building that is available for use, OK'd by owner John Adamo, a California real estate developer who owns six Main Street buildings.\\n\\nThe hope is to continue the art alley further north and south as building owners see progress. That in turn could encourage visitors to trek from the Corn Palace south to check out the art and likely, Main Street businesses.\\n\\nSherwood said anyone ages 5 to 95 can paint as a way to express themselves. Schwalm called it a living art piece, meaning it will get painted over eventually with a fresh look so it doesn't get stale.\\n\\n\\\"It opens the ability to paint in public to a lot more people, a lot more easily,\\\" Schwalm said.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"yahoo.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Yahoo\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Ethnic_and_Regional\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Ethnic and Regional\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Public_Art\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Public Art\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Collectives\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Collectives\",\"wgt\":100}],\"image\":\"https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.2392156862745098,\"wgt\":465177633,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398121\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:00:34\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:34Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:17Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://resistthemainstream.com/trump-teases-musks-future-desired-cabinet-position-with-efficient-two-word-phrase/\",\"title\":\"Trump Teases Musk's Future Desired Cabinet Position with Efficient Two-Word Phrase\",\"body\":\"Screenshots / YouTube, Fox News; TED, Cropped by Resist the Mainstream\\n\\nIn a rousing speech to supporters in Michigan on Friday, former President Donald Trump unveiled his vision for a revitalized American economy, with tech mogul Elon Musk playing a pivotal role as the administration's \\\"cost cutter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He's going to be our cost cutter,\\\" Trump said, referring to Musk, as reported by Biz News.\\n\\nTrump's remarks, delivered at a packed rally in Walker, Michigan, highlighted his plans to reinvigorate the nation's manufacturing sector and restore economic prosperity.\\n\\nTrump emphasized the importance of bringing jobs back to the United States, particularly in the automotive industry which has long been the backbone of Michigan's economy.\\n\\n\\\"We are going to attract numerous automobile manufacturing plants back to our nation,\\\" he declared, drawing enthusiastic cheers from his supporters.\\n\\nThe former president outlined his strategy to achieve this goal through a combination of tariffs and tax incentives designed to encourage foreign companies to relocate their production facilities to American soil.\\n\\nCentral to Trump's economic plan is the implementation of what he calls \\\"reciprocal\\\" tariffs. These tariffs would mirror those imposed by other countries on American imports, a move Trump believes will level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers.\\n\\nHe described tariffs as a \\\"beautiful word,\\\" suggesting they would be a key tool in his administration's efforts to revitalize American industry.\\n\\nThe former president didn't mince words when discussing the potential impact of his policies on foreign-made vehicles.\\n\\nTrump proposed a staggering 200% tariff on cars imported from Mexico, asserting that such a measure would make these vehicles \\\"unsellable\\\" in the U.S. market. This bold stance underscores his commitment to prioritizing American-made products and protecting domestic jobs.\\n\\nIn a surprising announcement, Trump revealed that Elon Musk, the innovative entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, would serve as the administration's \\\"cost cutter\\\" if he wins the November election. This decision signals Trump's intention to bring fresh, business-oriented thinking to government operations, potentially streamlining processes and reducing wasteful spending.\\n\\nTrump's choice of Musk for this role is particularly noteworthy given the tech titan's track record of disrupting traditional industries and driving innovation. Musk's experience in revolutionizing the automotive and space industries could prove invaluable in Trump's efforts to modernize and streamline government operations.\\n\\nThe former president also took aim at his political opponents, criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris's policies on her agenda around electric vehicles.\\n\\nTrump argued that Harris's push for electric cars would primarily benefit manufacturers in China and Mexico, rather than American workers. He positioned his own policies as a direct counter to this approach, promising to prioritize American jobs and manufacturing.\\n\\nTrump's message resonated strongly with the Michigan crowd, many of whom have witnessed firsthand the decline of the state's once-dominant automotive industry. His promises to revitalize manufacturing and bring jobs back to the United States struck a chord with supporters who view economic prosperity as a top priority.\\n\\nAs the election draws nearer, Trump's economic vision, coupled with the potential inclusion of high-profile figures like Elon Musk in his administration, is likely to be a central theme of his campaign. The former president's focus on job creation, tariffs, and American manufacturing presents a clear contrast to his opponents' policies, offering voters a distinct choice in November.\\n\\nWith Michigan's status as a key battleground state, Trump's message of economic renewal and job creation could prove crucial in swaying voters. As he told the enthusiastic crowd, \\\"We win Michigan, we win the whole thing... like we did in 2016.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"resistthemainstream.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Resist the Mainstream\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"anthony_gonzalez@resistthemainstream.com\",\"name\":\"Anthony Gonzalez\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Work\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Work\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Business\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Business\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Technology\",\"label\":\"news/Technology\",\"wgt\":59}],\"image\":\"https://resistthemainstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Untitled-design-29.png\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":37},\"sentiment\":0.4274509803921569,\"wgt\":465177634,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340397943\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:00:34\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:34Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:02Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nrl/article-13900685/Latrell-Mitchell-white-powder-photo-Braydon-Trindall-mother-assault-pub-Dubbo.html\",\"title\":\"Mother of NRL star in white powder scandal allegedly assaulted\",\"body\":\"The mother of Cronulla Sharks superstar Braydon Trindall has allegedly been assaulted months after denying accusations of leaking the white powder images of Latrell Mitchell.\\n\\nMitchell was suspended for one game and fined $20,000 after a photo emerged showing him leaning over a white substance in a hotel room after a trip to Dubbo while injured.\\n\\nIn addition to the NRL's penalty, the South Sydney Rabbitohs imposed their own fine of $100,000, with $80,000 suspended unless there is another breach of his contract or wellbeing program.\\n\\nDaily Mail Australia is not suggesting the powder contained any illicit substances.\\n\\nTrindall's mother, Kerri Cochrane, was dragged into the scandal when she was accused of leaking the photo of Latrell Mitchell.\\n\\nShe strongly denied the accusations, stating that a fake Snapchat profile had been created using her name to distribute the image.\\n\\nAmy Brown, who appeared in the photo with Mitchell, admitted to having a 'bit of fun' but denied leaking the image.

Mine is national, but you guys are local. And the degree to which you've brought in private industry to match it and make it work? I've never seen anything like it. Never seen anything close, honestly.\\\"\\n\\nThe Build Dakota Scholarship program is a statewide initiative created to increase the number of skilled workers entering into high-need sectors of the South Dakota workforce through the state's four technical colleges in Mitchell, Rapid City, Watertown and Sioux Falls.\\n\\nStudents of any age are eligible to apply for the scholarship, which supports tuition, books and other required program materials and expenses for eligible technical college programs. Recipients in the scholarship must commit to working in South Dakota, in their field of study, for three years following graduation.\\n\\nThe scholarship is a benefit for students, who receive on-the-job training, a full-ride scholarship and the security of guaranteed employment after graduation. Among the employer benefits are a cost-effective training pipeline and opportunities to connect with potential employees.\\n\\nKnown to audiences for his hosting role on \\\"Dirty Jobs\\\" and a baritone voice that has narrated television programs and documentaries, Rowe also knows a few things about the skilled trades. He grew up spending time with and admiring his grandfather, who worked as an electrician, among other jobs, and his time on \\\"Dirty Jobs,\\\" where he performed tasks in difficult and unusual careers, further opened his eyes to the importance of skilled trade work.\\n\\nto launch a national advocacy campaign for skilled labor. His foundation also provides scholarship opportunities to the tune of about $3 million a year for students who want to learn a skill that is in demand.\\n\\nThe Build Dakota Scholarship program is a kindred spirit, and one Rowe firmly believes in. Over the past decade, the program has awarded nearly 4,000 scholarships, working alongside over 500 industry partners providing more than $21 million in matching scholarships.\\n\\nAnd it's slowly helping shift outdated perceptions that trade schools are somehow lesser outposts for lesser educational opportunities, he said.\\n\\n\\\"They're starting to get the message, and the message is there's nothing wrong with a four-year degree, but the best path for the most people can't be the most expensive path. It just can't. And for decades, that's kind of what we've been suggesting to kids,\\\" Rowe said. \\\"Today we have $1.7 trillion in student loans on the books and eight million jobs, most of which don't require a four-year degree. So you're loaning money we don't have to kids who are never going to be able to pay it back for jobs that aren't really in demand. Is that starting to change? Yeah, it is. Is it going to take even longer? For sure.\\\"\\n\\nRowe praised state and local leadership for making the program a reality. State-level leaders like former Gov. Dennis Daugaard worked with the state legislature to match an initial $25 million investment in the idea from T. Denny Sanford to kick off the program.\\n\\nIndustry partners and local-level leaders, like Dick Muth, a Mitchell Tech grad and booster who founded Muth Electric, which has sponsored many Build Dakota scholars, and a member of the South Dakota Hall of Fame, have lent crucial support. Rowe said the program wouldn't exist without their forward thinking.\\n\\nHe said he sees the benefits of the scholarship program personified in the students climbing electrical poles at Mitchell Tech's powerline classes and their work in other programs. He even met a few individuals on the tour who had received scholarships from his own foundation.\\n\\n\\\"On a personal level, meeting guys who are climbing poles, who applied for a scholarship from my foundation and got one, running into them here, is very gratifying. So whether it's Build Dakota, whether it's mikeroweWORKS, there are plenty of places for a curious kid to get the money they need to embark on this thing.\\\"\\n\\nClayton Deuter, vice president of enrollment services for Mitchell Tech, said the day's activities were a celebration of the students and the scholarship, but having Rowe on hand to help mark the occasion was special. Deuter accompanied Rowe on the campus tour and noted his down-to-darth persona was a good match for students and staff.\\n\\nRowe understands the workforce situation and need, he said, and having a well-known television personality boosting for the scholarship and school is a definite plus.\\n\\n\\\"I think the biggest thing is it brings the spotlight to the Build Dakota Scholarship program and its 10 year anniversary, but it also brings a bigger spotlight to the high-need areas in the state,\\\" Deuter said. \\\"And those are in the trade and technical areas, whether it's nursing, radiology or heating and cooling. There's a wide variety of high-need programs, meaning that the industry needs the students desperately when they graduate. They just don't have enough people going out into the workforce.\\\"\\n\\nMitchell Tech is getting more and more of those professionals into a workforce hungry for them. About 99% of school graduates are employed or continuing their education within six months of graduation, according to the school website.\\n\\nIn the last 10 years, Mitchell Technical College has gone from offering around 55 Build Dakota Scholarships in the beginning to 155 scholarships this year, thanks in large part to the increase in industry partners working with the program, Deuter said. There are currently about 156 industry partners associated with the program, and Mitchell Tech has hosted 851 Build Dakota scholars on campus since the program's inception.\\n\\nThe benefits to students are myriad, Deuter said, and Mitchell Tech benefits itself from having good students on campus. All that jibes with the work Rowe is doing to sway opinions about technical colleges in general, he said.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of that is because of the Build Dakota Scholarship helping change that perception of technical colleges out there,\\\" Deuter said.\\n\\nRowe's visit Thursday concluded with a chat-style panel that also included Deuter, Muth, Mike Sprang, who serves as chair of the Mitchell Technical College Foundation board of trustees, and Dana Dykhouse, chair of the Build Dakota Scholarship board and CEO of First Premier Bank.\\n\\nIn a statement, Dykhouse both praised Rowe and reflected on the success of the scholarship program as well as the public and private sector cooperation at its heart.\\n\\n\\\"There's not a bigger name in technical education than Mike Rowe, and having him in South Dakota to help celebrate the success of the Build Dakota Scholarship program is a testament to the outstanding efforts of so many,\\\" Dykhouse said. \\\"I'm proud of the impact this program has had on the workforce issues facing our state and we should all be proud of the public-private partnership that made all of this a reality.\\\"\\n\\nThough not a part of the panel, Daugaard was also in attendance as a member of the audience. He praised individuals like Dykhouse for their leadership in the effort, along with the industry partners who have stepped in to work with students who are anxious to jump headlong into their new career.\\n\\nJudging by the ongoing support, he said he saw no reason the program wouldn't be serving students and the workforce for years to come.\\n\\n\\\"I'm just very excited after 10 years to see what the Build Dakota program has become. I had no way of foreseeing the way industry has responded,\\\" Daugaard told the Mitchell Republic. \\\"And now here we are, and the program has an endowment of over $40 million. So that will be providing scholarships in perpetuity.\\\"\\n\\nThe visit to Mitchell Tech Thursday followed stops at Lake Area Technical College in Watertown and Southeast Technical College in Sioux Falls where he also took tours and spoke with students and faculty. When his time in Mitchell wrapped up, he was scheduled to head west to Western Dakota Technical College in Rapid City.\\n\\nIt made for a long but fulfilling day for Rowe, who said he would continue to support efforts like the one he saw on display in Mitchell and across South Dakota.

It is the first thing some sore losers have turned to after losing a presidential election. In 2016, you may recall, many Democrats took solace or vented their frustration by pointing out that \\\"Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.\\\" These complaints were almost always followed closely by demands that the Electoral College be eliminated. It was and still is often said that unless the Electoral College is scrapped, we don't really have a democracy.\\n\\nThis is increasingly so as the Democratic Party exiles itself to urban areas. The party can run up individual vote totals in large Democratic cities while doing nothing to increase its chances of Electoral College votes from swing states that don't have a Los Angeles or New York City to produce a lopsided score.\\n\\nEnter the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. This is a plan of dubious constitutionality to undermine the electoral system. It would make elections less safe and even more partisan than they already are if you can imagine that.\\n\\nThe compact consists of states tying their votes in the Electoral College to the national popular vote total. It means that each state in the compact would award its electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes in the country, even if that candidate lost in that state. At present, 17 states and the District of Columbia have tied their 209 electoral votes to the national popular vote, getting closer to the 270 electoral votes needed for a candidate to become president.\\n\\nThe compact is popular only with Democrats, which makes sense because the party often wins the popular vote even when it loses the presidency. Democrats enthusiastic to tie their state's Electoral College votes to the popular vote assume this will help Democrats, as indeed it would in current circumstances. But it is utterly devoid of principle.\\n\\nThere is a useful thought experiment one can force upon Democrats when they tout the \\\"democratic\\\" principle of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. All you need to do is ask them this: \\\"So let's say your state voted for Kamala Harris, but Donald Trump won the popular vote, you'd be content that your state's Electoral College votes would be cast for Trump, right?\\\" This usually produces a certain amount of stuttering and foot shuffling and the circumstantial but unprincipled retort, \\\"But that's not likely to happen.\\\"\\n\\nThe compact fundamentally contradicts what America is supposed to be. We are the \\\"United States,\\\" or are supposed to be, which implies including all those participating in the federal system, not excluding those with whom one disagrees.\\n\\nThe states make up the country. The nation does not have the right to treat smaller states as subservient departments.\\n\\nThe loss of this concept of genuine federalism is why the federal government has become more intrusive in everyday life, as voters and the parties, especially the Democratic Party, expect the president to absorb responsibilities that should fall to state governments.\\n\\nThe national popular vote idea is thus a \\\"solution\\\" to a problem that doesn't exist. The system works as it is because it forces presidential candidates to make appeals to broad swaths of the country. Trump lost the popular vote but won 30 of the 50 states in 2016. A candidate needs to convince voters in Arizona, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Georgia, states with unique cultures and issues, that he or she should be president.\\n\\nA system that simply awarded the presidency to the winner of the most votes nationwide would produce campaigns intent solely on riling up their party base. If the country is divided now, as it is, imagine a national popular vote election that frees Democrats and Republicans alike from the tempering effect of \\\"swing states\\\" and instead encourages them to juice up antagonisms to drive their flock to polling places.\\n\\nThus far, only Democratic-controlled states and Washington, D.C., have signed on to the compact. This stems from Democratic chagrin about the 2000 election that Al Gore lost. They believe dearly that he should have been the winner because he \\\"won the popular vote\\\" against George W. Bush. The 2016 election revived that sentiment after Clinton \\\"won the popular vote\\\" but not the presidency.\\n\\nThe 2016 election is a perfect representation of how Democrats view the electoral system. Clinton's campaign ran up vote totals in big liberal cities. Her win by 2.9 million in the popular vote is due solely to her ability to rack up a landslide in California. She secured a margin of 1.7 million in Los Angeles County alone. Clinton was very popular in small pockets of the country where Democratic voters congregate, so both she and the Democratic Party think she shouldn't have to waste their time trying to win voters in the middle of the country. She didn't visit the swing state of Wisconsin once after the Democratic National Convention. She and the blue party regarded the heartland as literally flyover country. Basing the presidential election result on the national popular vote tally would make that permanent.\\n\\nDemocrats seem to think that because their popular vote margin doesn't mean anything in the current electoral system, that system must change. In truth, it is the Democrats who must change. They must change to try to win votes in flyover country. It is the same logic behind the Democratic push for statehood for Washington, D.C., which would gift the Democratic Party two senators. Democrats don't want to have to campaign in states in the middle of the country to get power on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nIt should be noted that the compact contains a trigger, and states don't have to pull that trigger until enough states join to reach 270 electoral votes. It's just another wrinkle Democrats added to ensure they don't accidentally award a Republican presidential candidate the White House in a scenario in which the GOP wins the \\\"popular vote\\\" but Democrats win the Electoral College, a possibility this November.\\n\\nSo, the popular vote compact fails in principle with what the U.S. is meant to be and fails in concept as a \\\"solution\\\" to an imagined problem, given that it is nothing more than a Democratic power grab. Just as damning, though, is that the national popular vote would fail in practice by making elections more prone to widespread fraud and fuel rampant distrust among the general public.\\n\\nIf you thought Trump's election conspiracy theories were bad in 2020, imagine how many people would reasonably believe them under a popular vote system. A national popular vote would encourage political actors in both parties to engage in all kinds of chicanery, including voter fraud and voter suppression, because the goal would simply be to have more votes total than the other team.\\n\\nWhile Trump's claims of massive voter fraud are weak, there is some fraud that pops up in competitive races, such as in the 2008 Senate race in Minnesota, which secured the Democratic Party the filibuster-proof Senate majority that gave us Obamacare. The incentive to cheat in a presidential election decided only by raw vote totals rather than electoral votes would lead to far more fraud on a much larger scale.\\n\\nThis isn't just a hypothetical, given that Democrats in Colorado, Maine, and Illinois all tried to remove Trump from their ballots. That would all but guarantee a Democratic win in the \\\"popular vote,\\\" resulting in a tit-for-tat in which each state ends up with one presidential candidate on the ballot depending on what party runs the state.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\\n\\nPicture the 2016 election, with Trump leading by some 2 million votes the day after the election, only for California's glacial vote count to chip away at that lead for more than a month. It wouldn't be until December that all the votes would be counted in California, giving far more credence to accusations that Democrats would \\\"find\\\" votes to make up the total they needed.\\n\\nThe national popular vote compact is lazy, destructive, ill-thought-out, blatantly partisan, and a defiance of the principles that make up America's federal system. It is thus the perfect Democratic policy. As a means of choosing American presidents, it would manage to make every aspect of campaigns, governance, institutional trust, and the balance of power between states and the federal government worse. Given that both parties claim their last presidential loss only happened because the race was \\\"stolen\\\" from them, this supposed \\\"solution\\\" couldn't come at a worse time.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"washingtonexaminer.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Washington Examiner\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"zachary_faria@washingtonexaminer.com\",\"name\":\"Zachary Faria\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Parties\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Parties\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Politics\",\"label\":\"news/Politics\",\"wgt\":98}],\"image\":\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hillary-clinton-kamala-harris-2024.webp\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9944770\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":8},\"sentiment\":-0.01960784313725494,\"wgt\":465177650,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340396427\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:00:52\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:52Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T23:57:25Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/09/28/former-pkr-reps-fail-in-appeal-bid-over-seats\",\"title\":\"Former PKR reps fail in appeal bid over seats\",\"body\":\"PUTRAJAYA: Two former Penang assemblymen failed yet again to challenge a motion passed by the state assembly that compelled them to vacate their seats.\\n\\nIn a unanimous decision yesterday, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals by former Sungai Acheh assemblyman Zulkifli Ibrahim and former Seberang Jaya assemblyman Dr Afif Bahardin.\\n\\nThe judgment was delivered by a three-judge panel.\\n\\n\\\"We find no error in the reasoning made by the High Court and we fully endorse the reasons of the High Court,\\\" said Justice Che Mohd Ruzima Ghazali, Bernama reported.\\n\\nZulkifli and Dr Afif were appealing against the Penang High Court's decision on Dec 8 last year, which upheld the motion passed by the state legislative assembly declaring their seats vacant.\\n\\nHigh Court judge Justice Anand Ponnudurai had ruled that Zulkifli and Dr Afif were rightly disqualified from the state legislative assembly following their expulsion from PKR, in accordance with Article 14A of the Penang state constitution, which prohibits party hopping.\\n\\nAfter their expulsion from PKR, Zulkifli and Dr Afif joined Bersatu, prompting the motion for them to vacate their seats.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"thestar.com.my\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"The Star \"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Law/Courts\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Law/Courts\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Business\",\"label\":\"news/Business\",\"wgt\":81}],\"image\":\"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/09/28/2936485.jpg\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":10},\"sentiment\":0.05098039215686279,\"wgt\":465177652,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398271\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:00:54\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:54Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:30Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.501960813999176,\"url\":\"https://www.ntd.com/remote-control-of-cars-could-cause-problems-expert_1019850.html\",\"title\":\"Remote Control of Cars Could Cause Problems: Expert\",\"body\":\"Washington is doubling down on rooting out a Chinese threat.

Unfortunately, its impact is still being felt. The death count is 40 people in four states.\\n\\nHurricane Helene left an enormous path of destruction across Florida and the entire southeastern U.S. on Friday, killing at least 40 people in four states, snapping trees like twigs, tearing apart homes and sending rescue crews on desperate missions to save people from floodwaters.\\n\\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp said dozens of people were still trapped in buildings damaged by the Category 4 hurricane. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 kph) when it made landfall late Thursday in a sparsely populated region in Florida's rural Big Bend area, home to fishing villages and vacation hideaways where Florida's Panhandle and peninsula meet.\\n\\nThe damage extended hundreds of miles to the north, with flooding as far away as northeast Tennessee, where a \\\"dangerous rescue situation\\\" was unfolding after 54 people were moved to the roof of the Unicoi County Hospital while rapid waters flooded the facility, according to Ballad Health.\\n\\nIn North Carolina, a lake used in the movie \\\"Dirty Dancing\\\" overtopped a dam. People in surrounding neighborhoods were evacuated, although there were no immediate concerns it was about to fail.\\n\\nSome climate scientists projected this might be a relatively quiet hurricane season due to the development of an Atlantic Ocean version of La Niรฑa. What appears to have happened is that the storm's development and movement were influenced by a combination of factors, including a high-pressure system to the northeast and a trough or low-pressure system to the northwest, creating a sort of \\\"conveyor belt\\\" steering Helene.\\n\\nThis effect is similar to what occurred with Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\\n\\nHelene is \\\"going to do a dance,\\\" but not with another hurricane or tropical storm, said Gus Alaka, director of the Hurricane Research Division at NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Lab.\\n\\nInstead, Helene is responding to the effects of a low-pressure weather system to its northwest.\\n\\nThat interaction is occurring in the upper levels of the atmosphere, where commercial jets fly, and not at surface level. That means it's not technically undergoing the Fujiwhara Effect.\\n\\nThe combination of that weather event to the northwest, and a high pressure system to the northeast, are creating a fast-moving \\\"conveyor belt\\\" for Helene, steering it and ultimately forcing it to a standstill over Tennessee, northern Georgia and lower Appalachia, Alaka said.\\n\\nThe interaction between a tropical storm and an atmospheric weather system is more common than the Fujiwhara Effect. Weather systems are common, regularly moving through the country and providing weather changes, Alaka said.\\n\\nUnfortunately, some of the deaths appear to be related to people ignoring evacuation orders. And the damage reports from Florida are already daunting.\\n\\nAll five who died in one Florida county were in neighborhoods where residents had been told to evacuate, said Bob Gualtieri, the sheriff in Pinellas County in the St. Petersburg area. He said people who stayed because they didn't believe the warnings wound up hiding in their attics to escape the rising water.\\n\\n...Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the damage from Helene appeared to be greater than the combined damage of Idalia and Hurricane Debby in August. \\\"It's demoralizing,\\\" he said.\\n\\nSocial media reports indicate widespread effects and recovery efforts will be lengthy.\\n\\nBut there is uplifting news of successful rescues.\\n\\nAnd one weatherman took the storm personally (satire).\\n\\nPrayers of support continue for all our friends in the Southeastern US.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"legalinsurrection.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Leยทgal Inยทsurยทrecยทtion\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"leslie_eastman@legalinsurrection.com\",\"name\":\"Leslie Eastman\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Environment\",\"label\":\"news/Environment\",\"wgt\":73}],\"image\":\"https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hurricane-Helene-Florida.jpg\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":17},\"sentiment\":-0.4117647058823529,\"wgt\":465177624,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398016\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:00:29\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:29Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:09Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.5529412031173706,\"url\":\"https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/politics/3103040-justice-department-sues-alabama-over-voter-roll-purge\",\"title\":\"Justice Department Sues Alabama Over Voter Roll Purge | Politics\",\"body\":\"The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Alabama, alleging that the state's attempt to remove non-citizens from voter rolls violates federal law.

(NASDAQ:EQ), a biotechnology firm specializing in pharmaceutical preparations, has reported a recent transaction involving its Chief Financial Officer, Jason A. Keyes. According to a new filing, Keyes sold 10,000 shares of company stock, resulting in total proceeds of $8,100.\\n\\nThe transaction, which took place on September 26, 2024, was executed under a 10b5-1 trading plan previously adopted by Keyes on March 27, 2024. This type of trading plan allows company insiders to sell shares over a predetermined period of time, providing a defense against potential claims of insider trading.\\n\\nThe shares were sold at a weighted average price of $0.81. However, the sales were not made at a single price point; they occurred in multiple transactions with prices ranging from $0.79 to $0.82. Should any parties require further details on the exact number of shares sold at each price within this range, Keyes has agreed to furnish full information upon request.\\n\\nFollowing the sale, Keyes still retains a substantial interest in Equillium, Inc., with 57,720 shares held indirectly through The Keyes Trust, dated September 10, 2004. Additionally, Keyes directly owns 73,913 shares of the company's common stock.\\n\\nInvestors and interested parties often monitor insider transactions as they can provide insights into the executives' perspectives on the company's current valuation and future prospects.\\n\\nIn other recent news, Equillium Inc . announced its Phase 3 EQUATOR study of itolizumab, a drug candidate for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), will proceed without modifications following a favorable recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. This development is significant given the high mortality rates associated with aGVHD and the limited effectiveness of current treatments. In another development, Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has a 90-day period to decide on acquiring Equillium's rights to itolizumab for approximately $35 million, with potential additional milestone payments that could total $101.4 million.\\n\\nEquillium also disclosed an estimated $33.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a recent regulatory filing. The company reported positive results from its Phase 2 study of EQ101, a novel therapy for alopecia areata, and a Phase 1b EQUALISE trial on itolizumab, a new treatment for lupus nephritis.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Nasdaq has notified Equillium that it is currently not in compliance with the exchange's minimum bid price requirement. The company has been granted a 180-day grace period to address the issue and regain compliance. These are recent developments in Equillium's larger initiative to tackle autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.\\n\\nTo provide additional context to Jason A. Keyes' recent stock sale, let's examine some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro for Equillium, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQ).\\n\\nAs of the latest data, Equillium's market capitalization stands at $29.47 million, reflecting its current valuation in the biotechnology sector. The company has demonstrated strong revenue growth, with a 51.83% increase in quarterly revenue as of Q2 2024. This growth trajectory aligns with the company's focus on pharmaceutical preparations and could be a factor in executive decision-making regarding stock transactions.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that Equillium is currently operating at a loss, with an adjusted operating income of -$9.71 million over the last twelve months. This is reflected in one of the InvestingPro Tips, which indicates that analysts do not anticipate the company to be profitable this year. This financial situation might provide context for why insiders like Keyes might choose to sell some of their holdings.\\n\\nAnother relevant InvestingPro Tip highlights that Equillium's stock price movements are quite volatile. This volatility is evident in the company's recent price performance, with a strong 24.58% return over the last three months, contrasted by a significant -59.6% decline over the past six months. Such fluctuations could influence insider trading decisions and timing.\\n\\nFor investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights.

This audio drama stars a number of local voice actors and volunteers.\\n\\nDouglas sat down with state historian Stan Bumgardner to discuss the event and the atmosphere in Mingo County at the time.\\n\\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nDouglas: Let's talk about the atmosphere in West Virginia in 1914.\\n\\nBumgardner: 1914 is in some ways, a pivotal year in West Virginia. There's no way to quantify this, but certainly one of the deadliest coal mine strikes, or strikes period, in U.S. history was at Paint Creek and Cabin Creek in Kanawha County. At the time of the Glen Alum robbery, prohibition had just come into effect in West Virginia, which happened nearly six years before it happened nationally.\\n\\nBut what was happening in southern West Virginia was just massive change. And I mean, everything was changing. Before the Civil War, and even after the Civil War, you know, this had been a sparsely populated area, just some scattered farmland, and really not much of that because of the terrain. If you look at the census numbers, very few people lived in Mingo County, and in certain parts of McDowell County, very few people lived there until the railroads came. The railroad started coming in the 1880s and then by the 1890s, the Norfolk and Western had reached what's now Mingo County. At that time it was part of Logan County. Mingo County is our newest county. It came in in 1895 and it's almost solely due to the arrival of the N&W, the Norfolk and Western, and the opening of coal mines. Towns were being built, seemingly overnight, they were all over the place in that part of the state, and places where almost nobody had lived.\\n\\nDouglas: I've always wondered about that. I knew Mingo split off from Logan, but I always wondered why, and so it was just growing so fast that somebody decided, no, we need a separate local government.\\n\\nBumgardner: The area that's now Mingo County was kind of an isolated part of Logan County before the N&W arrived. However, when the N&W arrived,there was such an influx of people.The old rule was that you were supposed to be able to get to the county seat and back in a day. That's how they determined county borders. And that's why today, it seems ridiculous sometimes that we have counties with county seats that you can drive to, they're 20 minutes apart, right? But back then you might need a whole day or more. The influx of population into Mingo County was incredible at that time period. The other thing is that you had competing railroads, competing coal companies. The Norfolk and Western was a little different from other railroads that came through. They had watched what had happened with the Chesapeake and Ohio, which came in the 1870s and when that railroad came through southern West Virginia, you had a lot of what I'd call freelance coal operators who just came in and took advantage of the fact that there was this railroad now that they could get the coal to market. That's what was holding back the coal industry, mainly in southern West Virginia, is just, how do you get it out of there?\\n\\nSo when the Chesapeake and Ohio, the C&O came through, there were examples of miners who just became rich, who figured out how to run their own operations. There were coal operators who moved into the region. By the time the N&W came around, the organizers realized, \\\"We're missing out on half of the money.\\\" The railroads were making a lot of the money, but there's a lot of money to be made in mining the coal. So the N&W with a decade of knowledge about what has happened with the C&O, the N&W's leaders went in and bought massive amounts of coal land adjoining the railroads and adjoining the branches of the railroads. So, Mingo County was very much an N&W county. If you're in control of the economy and you can control the government, then you've got the whole shebang.\\n\\nDouglas: Why was prohibition in six years before national prohibition? How did that happen?\\n\\nBumgardner: Men were getting paid on Friday, and by Saturday, the money was all gone on alcohol. And there were problems associated with alcohol and towns that cater to that. You had some now legendary drinking and red light districts and things in southern West Virginia that were being called to attention. Essentially, they had just gotten enough votes by 1914 but this was a movement that was sweeping the country. There were many states that were going dry before it happened nationally. It should be noted that there was a kind of a racist component to some in the temperance movement and they did this very publicly. They associated drinking and the problems with drinking, particularly with immigrants, and so that became a target. It was kind of an anti-immigrant movement as well as an anti-drinking movement.\\n\\nDouglas: I've often wondered, this massive influx of immigrant populations coming into work in the mines and on the railroads, was there a lot of pushback among the native born, or did they remember that they were just one or two generations removed themselves and didn't worry about it a whole lot?\\n\\nBumgardner: It was an interesting situation. There was a very anti-immigrant philosophy that was happening all across the country, that the immigrants were coming in, particularly from Eastern Europe, and that they were taking jobs away from native born West Virginians and native born Americans. But there weren't enough laborers to fill the jobs. West Virginia's economy was really booming. That sounds like something we can't relate to because of what West Virginia's economic situation has been for so long. But people were pouring into West Virginia to fill jobs, and they couldn't fill the job fast enough, whether it was in coal mines or factories wherever. And so there was a need for all of this labor. But this gets into some of the trying to stop the labor movement from developing is that coal mine operators would one of them, Justus Collins even referred to it as a judicious mixture, which was, \\\"We want the right balance of native born whites and blacks and immigrants to help balance off each other,\\\" and it was successful at times. They fomented this resentment toward these other groups so they wouldn't pull together in union.\\n\\nDouglas: Let's talk about the Black Hand for a second. So as my understanding, a lot of that was up in the northern part of the state, in the Italian community. But give me the short version of what the Black Hand was.\\n\\nBumgardner: The Black Hand is often associated with, it's even used interchangeably with, the mafia, but it's not. It's a variation of all that. They were principally into extortion and it was extortion by Italian immigrants and Italian Americans against Italian immigrants that they would threaten, they would blackmail. There were kidnappings, or threatenings of kidnappings, of murder, and unless you paid up money, unless you paid a percentage of your business. If you were an Italian storekeeper, you were a target. If you were an Italian professional who made money, you were a target of the Black Hand.\\n\\nDouglas: I recall reading that if you were the subject of this, you would get a letter. I don't know if it was in the mail or it was just stuck under your door, and there would be a drawing of a black hand on it, or a couple different other symbols.\\n\\nBumgardner: It wasn't just a one time deal. Once you paid them, you kept paying to them. It was a regular racket, so you had to pay a percentage of what you brought in. It was a very scary time for Italian immigrants. And that's a key point, it was such a small percentage of people, of Italians, who were doing this to other Italian immigrants that they were taking advantage of these people who had limited knowledge of the laws, of the language, of anything else. And many people felt like, well, the law enforcement is not going to protect us. Our neighbors aren't going to protect us, so we have to either pay up or defend ourselves.\\n\\nDouglas: Now we've set the stage for the audio drama, \\\"The Last Train to Glen Alum,\\\" let's talk about what happened.\\n\\nBumgardner: Again, it goes back to money. There were tens of thousands of dollars pouring into towns through railroad depots every day just to meet payroll. It was August 14, 1914 and the N&W train was coming into Glen Alum and Mingo County carrying its $7,000 cash payroll. Just like in old movies, they knew. The robbers knew exactly when the train was going to arrive. It always arrived at the same time. They knew how much money was going to be on, because the payroll was the same. It was very easy to plan when things are that scheduled and that regular. It makes it a lot easier to plan a robbery, especially when there's not a strong law enforcement presence.\\n\\nDouglas: Sheriff Hatfield didn't have a half dozen deputies standing around.\\n\\nBumgardner: I don't want to make it sound like a pleasant thing, because there was a lot of corruption. But, it was kind of like on \\\"The Andy Griffith Show\\\" in Mayberry, where there's one sheriff and a deputy, and they can handle minor problems that occur. But three guys get murdered and $7,000 gets stolen, a handful of law enforcement people aren't going to track these people down knowing that they're premeditated murderers and robbers. I mean, this wasn't a crime of passion. These people had planned this and killed in cold blood, and they certainly would be willing to do it again.\\n\\nHe started with they think between 25 and 50 men, but nobody knows exactly. The mines shut down, businesses shut down, and men joined the posse. It eventually built up to hundreds of men. So Sheriff Greenway Hatfield had a small army to go after five men, but still they were looking in one of the most rural, rugged areas of West Virginia.\\n\\nAnd so it was easy to hide, but if you look long enough, you're going to catch them, because the criminals didn't really have a great escape plan. That's been my take on it forever, is that they planned the robbery. They planned everything about it, but they didn't really figure out \\\"How are we getting out of here efficiently?\\\" Maybe they thought word wouldn't spread. Maybe they thought they had a few days before anyone would find out. But it clearly wasn't thought out very well.\\n\\nDouglas: When the posse ultimately killed the robbers, they were Italian or appeared to be Italian, but nobody knew who they were. They laid them out in town like you see in the Old West stories. But nobody ever came to claim them. What does that say to you?\\n\\nBumgardner: Especially with immigrants in the early 20th century in West Virginia, the head of the family would come over first and establish himself, and then send for their families. And sometimes they never sent for their families. Sometimes, bad things would happen to them like, as we discussed with the Black Hand. So when you have so many new people pouring into an area, it's hard to document who's there.\\n\\nMingo County's population doubled between 1900 and 1910. There's certainly a 1910 census that shows us who was there. But then, by 1920, it increased more than 50 percent again. And so there are people who are in and out of West Virginia between the censuses that nobody knew and that and that they probably didn't have family, maybe not in this country. So when crimes like this happened, or people were killed, and you see this with miners, a lot with immigrant miners, is many of them were unidentified, or there was nobody to claim the body.\\n\\nAnd that worked, also, if you're a criminal. That worked to your benefit, because if nobody knows you, then they can't identify you. That was happening with prohibition. Right after prohibition was enacted in West Virginia, almost the exact same time, you have an influx of criminals who are just essentially jumping from state to state, who are taking advantage of prohibition by selling bootleg liquor, and if something happens to them, you know, they don't have family, they don't know anybody around. They've just disappeared, or they've run off with somebody.\\n\\nAnother place you see that was the Hawks Nest tunnel disaster, not because they're criminals, but you had hundreds and hundreds, some have estimated nearly 1,000 people over the years, died building the Hawks Nest tunnel. So many of them were anonymous because they had migrated to West Virginia, either from other countries or Blacks in the South. If they just disappeared, didn't return home, didn't send word home, the thinking was, well, maybe they just ran off, right? They went and got killed, and their identities were lost to history.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"wvpublic.org\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"W Public Broadcasting\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"eric_douglas@wvpublic.org\",\"name\":\"Eric Douglas\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Advice\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Advice\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Politics\",\"label\":\"news/Politics\",\"wgt\":53}],\"image\":\"https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Glen-Alum-Landscape-Design.png\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1},\"sentiment\":0.0117647058823529,\"wgt\":465177665,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398384\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:01:08\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:08Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:47Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://foreignaffairs.co.nz/2024/09/28/mil-osi-new-zealand-raising-speed-limits-will-cost-our-communities/\",\"title\":\"MIL-OSI New Zealand: Raising speed limits will cost our communities\",\"body\":\"The Government's move to disregard all evidence and increase speed limits will result in serious harm.\\n\\n\\\"The science is conclusive and the evidence is overwhelming: safe speeds save lives,\\\" says the Green Party's Transport spokesperson, Julie Anne Genter.\\n\\n\\\"Our kids should be free to walk and cycle to school without worry.

The BJP is still seen by many here as the party in Delhi which took away their autonomy.\\n\\nMaleha Sofi, 24, is disillusioned with the BJP, believing the touted peace has come at the cost of personal liberties, and has decided not to vote. \\\"We are not allowed to say anything,\\\" she says.\\n\\nLegacy parties like the People's Democratic Party (PDP) have made this central to their campaign.\\n\\n\\\"This election is an act of self-preservation for Kashmiris,\\\" says Waheed Para, the party's candidate from Pulwama. \\\"It's a step to reclaim what was lost and preserve what we have.\\\"\\n\\nIn 2020, Para was jailed for nearly two years, accused of aiding banned separatist groups. India has long faced accusations of human rights violations in Kashmir - it denies this - but critics say this has intensified in the past few years.\\n\\nAhead of the assembly election, Amnesty International accused the government of fostering a \\\"climate of fear\\\" and urged an end to arbitrary detentions under strict anti-terror laws used to silence dissent on Jammu and Kashmir.\\n\\nBut the BJP government in Delhi has always taken a hard line on this. Aijaz says \\\"all those people who are with separatists will be dealt with very seriously\\\".\\n\\nWhile regional political parties promise change and say they are fighting for the rights of Kashmiris, how much influence will they have after these elections?\\n\\nLawyer Zafar Shah anticipates friction between the federal administration and the elected government which will soon assume charge.\\n\\nBefore 2019, when Jammu and Kashmir was a state, the chief minister could enact laws with the consent of the governor, who was bound by the state cabinet's recommendations.\\n\\nNow, as a federal territory under a Lieutenant Governor (LG), the chief minister must get the LG's approval, especially on sensitive issues like public order, appointments and prosecutions. Power has shifted, says Mr Shah, as the LG won't act without clearance from the federal home ministry.\\n\\n\\\"Whether the LG can create hurdles in the government's working, that's a matter to be seen when an actual situation arises,\\\" adds Mr Shah.\\n\\nDespite the challenges, many in Kashmir hope these elections will give them a chance to finally have their own representatives to voice their concerns.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"yahoo.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Yahoo\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Politics\",\"label\":\"news/Politics\",\"wgt\":99}],\"image\":\"https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/70a5f70a5e0083b66f12b28848b6a503\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":-0.1607843137254902,\"wgt\":465177668,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340395107\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:01:09\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:09Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T23:54:10Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/over-50-people-trapped-tennessee-234033232.html\",\"title\":\"Over 50 People Trapped on Tennessee Hospital Roof by Hurricane Helene Floodwaters Rescued\",\"body\":\"More than 50 patients and doctors who were forced to evacuate to the roof of Unicoi County Hospital have been rescued by state police aircrafts\\n\\nOver 50 people who were left stranded on the roof of a Tennessee hospital due to flooding from Hurricane Helene have been rescued, police said.\\n\\nAfter the Category 4 hurricane tore through several U.S. states on the night of Thursday, Sept. 26, many communities were left with severe flooding -- including Unicoi County, Tenn.

According to a report in Variety, Syfy and USA Network have canceled the horror/comedy series Chucky after three seasons. Apparently, there was some talk of doing a shorter fourth season, or possibly a movie, to wrap up the storylines. Ultimately, those talks went nowhere. Chucky, which focuses on the killer doll who starred in seven films in the Child's Play franchise, premiered in 2021. From the start, the series got lots of love from the fans. Series creator Don Mancini had this to say in a statement:\\n\\nI'm heartbroken over the news that Chucky won't be coming back for a fourth season, but am so grateful for the killer three years we did have. I'd like to thank UCP/SYFY/Peacock/Eat the Cat, our awesome cast and Toronto-based crew (the best in the business), and finally, to our amazing fans, a big bloody hug. Your incredible #RenewChucky campaign really warmed Chucky's cold heart. Chucky will return! He ALWAYS come back.\\n\\nMancini is not wrong about his creation Chucky always finding a way to come back from the grave. Many fans believed that after the 2019 reboot of Child's Play, which Mancini was not involved with, that would be the end of the original iteration of the character. But the version voiced by Brad Dourif returned for the TV series, which ignored the events of the reboot and continued on from the original continuity. Don Mancini has written all seven Chucky films since the first Child's Play back in 1988, never abandoning his beloved (and homicidal) Good Guys doll. You just can't keep a good slasher down, and Chucky is no exception. Right now, it's just a question of when, and how, Charles Lee Ray will come back to torment us all.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"nerdist.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Nerdist\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Arts_and_Entertainment\",\"label\":\"news/Arts and Entertainment\",\"wgt\":93}],\"image\":\"https://legendary-digital-network-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/27164110/Chucky-with-knife.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9945404\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":34},\"sentiment\":0.1372549019607843,\"wgt\":465177669,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398328\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:01:11\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:11Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:39Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/music/new-life-is-beautiful-festival-offshoot-debuts-in-downtown-vegas-3178640/\",\"title\":\"New Life is Beautiful festival offshoot debuts in downtown Vegas\",\"body\":\"It made sense that they took the stage backed by Judas Priest levels of Marshall stacks behind them.\\n\\nWhen Parisian electro duo Justice last played Life is Beautiful in 2018, they delivered dance music with heavy metal thunder, uniting the once-warring factions of disco and prog rock with a performance that intermingled the latter's far-out, experimental synth sounds with the former's limber bass lines and splashy rhythms.\\n\\nThink of it as electronic funk as full-contact sport, enhanced with a light show that would have had Rush taking notes.\\n\\nSix years later, Justice return to christen the debut of A Big Beautiful Block Party, a Life is Beautiful offshoot that takes over a portion of the Plaza grounds today and Saturday.\\n\\nWith seven acts performing on two stages, there will be no overlapping set times.

It is characterised by irregular ovulation, often resulting in infertility.\\n\\nWomen with PCOS may have ovaries containing numerous small cystic structures. PCOS is the leading cause of anovulation and a major contributor to female infertility, affecting between 40 percent and 80 percent of women with the condition.\\n\\nThe prevalence of PCOS and its associated infertility rates are substantial.\\n\\nThe impact of PCOS on menstruation and fertility is profound. In a typical menstrual cycle, a mature follicle develops, leading to ovulation. If pregnancy does not occur, a woman would expect to have a menstrual period approximately 14 days after ovulation.\\n\\nThe primary difference between polycystic ovaries and normal ovaries lies in the development of follicles. While polycystic ovaries contain numerous small follicles with eggs, these follicles often fail to mature properly, preventing ovulation.\\n\\nWithout regular ovulation, menstrual periods become irregular or absent, and pregnancy becomes difficult or impossible. If you are a woman with PCOS, you would frequently experience abnormal bleeding, infertility, obesity, excess hair growth, hair loss, and acne.\\n\\nSome women with PCOS may ovulate occasionally or not at all, making conception challenging and often requiring medical intervention to improve fertility.\\n\\nHormones, such as testosterone and rostenedione, lead to increased facial and body hair growth (hirsutism). While depression is a potential side effect of PCOS, it may not manifest physically or psychologically in all individuals.\\n\\nIt is important to note that not all women with PCOS exhibit obvious signs or symptoms. Some women may remain unaware of their condition until they undergo fertility testing. Additionally, while approximately half of women with PCOS are overweight, the other half may maintain a normal weight.\\n\\nThe relationship between PCOS and obesity is complex. While weight gain can exacerbate PCOS symptoms, it is not the primary cause of the condition. It is a fact that many women with PCOS maintain a normal weight.\\n\\nInsulin resistance, a common feature of PCOS, may contribute to weight gain and difficulty in losing weight. As a PCOS patient, you can consult with a regular obstetrician, but if you are diagnosed with severe insulin resistance, diabetes, or high blood pressure, you would certainly require the expertise of a high-risk obstetrician.\\n\\nFertility testing is recommended for you with PCOS, even if a previous diagnosis has been made. This is important for both you and your partner to understand your fertility status.\\n\\nUndergoing fertility assessments for both of you can identify additional factors that may contribute to infertility, such as male infertility, which may also require treatment.\\n\\nThe likelihood of conceiving with a PCOS diagnosis is relatively high. So if you have PCOS, you can successfully have a baby through fertility treatments. If you are under 35 with PCOS, the primary question is not whether treatment can work but rather which treatment option will be most effective for you.\\n\\nThere is no cure for PCOS presently, but some women do have a normalisation of cycles after a pregnancy. Those with fertility problems may find it easier to get pregnant again. Many medications can be used to control PCOS symptoms, and some may be used in combination with each other.\\n\\nThe best course of action depends on individual needs. PCOS may worsen during the prime reproductive years, ages 20-40, especially with weight gain. A healthy lifestyle is probably the best defense.\\n\\nIt seems as women approach menopause that the severity of PCOS improves, as judged by hormonal parameters. Treatment for PCOS and infertility often begins with ultrasound diagnosis. In a polycystic ovary, the numerous small cystic structures, give the ovaries a characteristic \\\"polycystic\\\" (many cysts) appearance on ultrasound.\\n\\nAfter reviewing your medical history, the physician will determine which tests are necessary. If you have irregular or absent menstrual periods, clues from the physical examination will be considered next.\\n\\nYour height and weight will be noted along with any increased facial or body hair or loss of scalp hair, acne and as well as a discoloration of the skin under the arms, breasts, and in the groin. Elevated androgen levels (male hormones), or testosterone help make the diagnosis.\\n\\nA good option for you as a couple dealing with PCOS is to undergo IVF. How successful IVF will be, though, can depend very much upon your characteristics such as age, length of infertility, and weight.\\n\\nAdditionally, neither IVF nor ovarian stimulation is likely to be successful if you are severely overweight, particularly with a body mass index greater than 30.\\n\\nDespite the problems that can present themselves to you suffering from PCOS, you can still look forward to getting pregnant. A successful pregnancy is entirely possible and has been experienced by numerous women with PCOS.\\n\\nIn fact, for many women, getting pregnant the second time around is much easier. Furthermore, it is not unusual for you with PCOS to notice that your menstrual cycle begins to regulate itself after a pregnancy.\\n\\nThe bottom line: You can get pregnant with PCOS. You will likely need to have moderate weight, balance your blood sugar levels, and treat other PCOS symptoms with healthy lifestyle changes and medications.\\n\\nIn some cases, fertility medications alone will help you get pregnant. If that doesn't work, you may need IVF treatment. But regardless of what treatment you explore, don't lose hope. Success rates are optimistic. In time, you may be smiling, positive pregnancy test in hand.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"punchng.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Punch Newspapers\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"abayomi_ajayi@punchng.com\",\"name\":\"Abayomi Ajayi\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Menstruation\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Menstruation\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Menopause\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Menopause\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Health\",\"label\":\"news/Health\",\"wgt\":99}],\"image\":\"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06003853/Abayomi-Ajayi.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9945779\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":57},\"sentiment\":-0.04313725490196074,\"wgt\":465177680,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398454\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:01:22\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:22Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:51Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.7215686440467834,\"url\":\"https://punchng.com/policemen-face-trial-over-n1m-extortion-from-corpers/\",\"title\":\"Policemen face trial over N1m extortion from corpers\",\"body\":\"The Lagos State Police Command said it has begun the trial of four police officers accused of extorting N1m from three members of the National Youth Service Corps in the Surulere area of the state.\\n\\nOn Thursday evening, an X user, Oluyemi Fasipe, shared that the officers, from Area C Police Command in Surulere, allegedly extorted the sum of N1 million from three members of the National Youth Corps members.\\n\\nIt was gathered that the corps members were stopped along the Surulere expressway before a group of officers surrounded their vehicle and started conducting a search.

She never took \\\"the time to discover who she truly was. It wasn't until she asked herself the question, 'Who am I?' that she realized she was a people pleaser.

Earlier this month, X filed paperwork informing Brazil's supreme court that it is now in compliance with orders, which it previously defied.\\n\\nAs Brazil's G1 Globo reported, X must now pay a new fine of 10 million reals (about $2 million) for two additional days of non-compliance with the court's orders. X's legal representative in Brazil, Rachel de Oliveira, is also required to pay a fine of 300,000 reals.\\n\\nThe case dates back to April, when de Moraes, the minister of Brazil's supreme court, known as Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), initiated a probe into Musk and X over alleged obstruction of justice.\\n\\nMusk had vowed to defy the court's orders to take down certain accounts in Brazil. He called the court's actions \\\"censorship,\\\" and railed online against de Moraes, describing the judge as a \\\"criminal\\\" and encouraging the U.S. to end foreign aid to Brazil.\\n\\nIn mid-August, Musk closed down X offices in Brazil. That left his company without a legal representative in the country, a federal requirement for all tech platforms to do business there.\\n\\nBy Aug. 28, de Moraes' court threatened a ban and fines if X didn't appoint a legal representative within 24 hours, and if it didn't comply with takedown requests for accounts the court said had engaged in plots to dox or harm federal agents, among other things.\\n\\nEarlier this month, the STF froze the business assets of Musk companies, including both X and satellite internet business Starlink, operating in Brazil. The STF said in court filings that it viewed Starlink parent SpaceX and X as companies that worked together as related parties.\\n\\nMusk wrote in a post on X at that time that, \\\"Unless the Brazilian government returns the illegally seized property of and SpaceX, we will seek reciprocal seizure of government assets too.\\\"\\n\\nAs head of the STF, de Moraes has long supported federal regulations to rein in hate speech and misinformation online. His views have garnered pushback from tech companies and far-right officials in the country, along with former President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters.\\n\\nBolsonaro is under investigation, suspected of orchestrating a coup in Brazil after losing the 2022 presidential election to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\\n\\nWhile Musk has called for retribution against de Moraes and Lula, he has worked with and praised Bolsonaro for years. The former president of Brazil authorized SpaceX to deliver satellite internet services commercially in Brazil in 2022.\\n\\nMusk bills himself as a free speech defender, but his track record suggests otherwise. Under his management, X removed content critical of ruling parties in Turkey and India at the government's insistence. X agreed to more than 80% of government take-down requests in 2023 over a comparable period the prior year, according to analysis by the tech news site Rest of World.\\n\\nX faces increased competition in Brazil from social apps like Meta-owned Threads, and Bluesky, which have attracted users during its suspension.\\n\\nStarlink also faces competition in Brazil from eSpace, a French-American firm that gained permission this year from the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) to deliver satellite internet services in the country.\\n\\nLukas Darien, an attorney and law professor at Brazil's Facex University Center, told CNBC that the STF's enforcement actions against X are likely to change the way large technology companies will view the court.\\n\\n\\\"There is no change to the law here,\\\" Darien wrote in a message. \\\"But specifically, big tech companies are now aware that the laws will be applied regardless of the size of a business and the magnitude of its reach in the country.\\\"\\n\\nMusk and representatives for X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\\n\\nLate Thursday, X Global Government Affairs posted the following statement:\\n\\n\\\"X is committed to protecting free speech within the boundaries of the law and we recognize and respect the sovereignty of the countries in which we operate.

What are other countries doing about it? | Alan Kohler\",\"body\":\"Australia is not the only country facing a housing crisis. Alan Kohler takes us on a whistle-stop tour of five governments trying to make homes more affordable\\n\\nAlthough Australians are naturally focused on their own housing misery, the truth is that the crisis is global. Much of the developed world has a dire housing shortage and prices are rapidly becoming unaffordable everywhere, or already are. Leo Tolstoy's maxim \\\"Happy families are all alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\\\" applies to each country's problems with housing.\\n\\nLeaving aside the migration and refugee flows that are causing extreme housing shortages in some countries, the number of houses being built in the world is simply falling short of population growth, even though that growth is declining. UN-ยญHabitat says the world needs to build 96,000 affordable homes every day to house the 3 billion people who will need adequate housing by 2030.\\n\\nAnd just as each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, each country is dealing with housing in its own way - some are doing it well, some not so well. Here are a few of them.\\n\\nNew Zealand's house prices started rising rapidly around 1980 and have since gone from twice average incomes to nine times - a bigger increase than in Australia, but over a longer period. In the past 25 years, Kiwi house prices have even outpaced Australia's.\\n\\nNow the government has introduced funding schemes totalling NZ$3.8bn to unlock more land for housing development by supporting infrastructure, and has enacted the Infrastructure Funding and Financing Act 2020 to help developers raise long-ยญterm financing for infrastructure to support new housing.\\n\\nTo try to dampen demand, the government has also tightened loan-ยญto-ยญvalue ratio restrictions on the banks, and the NZ Reserve Bank has raised the official cash rate to bring inflation down, but also to curb highly leveraged borrowing. Furthermore, some new interest deductibility rules have been introduced to discourage property investment, and overseas investment legislation was reviewed in 2018 to restrict foreign buyers of residential land, except for citizens and residents of Australia and Singapore (Peter Dutton would approve).\\n\\nBut the most interesting thing going on in New Zealand was a zoning experiment in Auckland in 2016, in which the council removed restrictions in some areas, opening up suburban blocks to higher-ยญdensity housing. It was a huge success, at least in terms of housing supply in those areas (although they found out later what the local residents thought - there was, of course, a backlash).\\n\\nIt was so successful that the Labour government decided to bring it in for the whole country, but then it lost the 2023 election and the incoming National government, which had earlier supported the legislation, reversed its stance during the campaign and then duly repealed most of it. The Nationals justified the reversal by claiming they \\\"got it wrong\\\" on the medium density residential standards and were responding to concerns from suburban residents opposed to densification in their neighbourhoods. Yes, Nimbyism at work - one of the most powerful forces in the world pushing up house prices.\\n\\nJapan has seen remarkable success in supplying affordable housing - even in the major cities. Thirty years ago, property in Tokyo was the most expensive in the world. Then there was a devastating crash which is still reverberating today, but other countries have caught up and gone past, so Japanese housing is relatively affordable. While average rents in Sydney are more than A$3,000 per month, in Tokyo they're about $2,500. The median dwelling price in Sydney is $1.156m; in Tokyo it's 70m yen, or $680,000.\\n\\nThis isn't the result of government-ยญbuilt social housing, or danchi as it's called - less than 5%of homes across Japan are socially rented. It's simply because they build a lot more houses. The houses are much smaller, of course - 94.85 sq metres on average versus 252 sq metres in Australia - but that's partly because they're building a lot more one-ยญbedroom flats for singles and young couples, who more often live alone rather than sharing.\\n\\nThe planning system behind this is simple zoning that promotes across-ยญthe-ยญboard development rather than granting planning permission for each individual site. There are 12 zones, each defined by the nuisance level they allow, ranging from residential to industrial. It means pretty much anything can be built, provided it does not exceed that zone's nuisance level. So supply can respond quickly as demand changes and ensures development and density is driven by land values. If the demand increases, old houses can easily be knocked down to increase density.\\n\\nAnother factor promoting the building of new homes is tax: the valuation of land and buildings for property taxes, or rates, paid to local councils declines over time, which increases the incentive for the councils to approve new houses to get their rates back up.\\n\\nAustrians pay a housing tax of about 1% of inยญยญcome and employers contribute as well. The money from the tax is then distributed among the nine Austrian provinces.\\n\\nThere are various kinds of housing that are either fully owned by the City of Vienna, which are called Gemeindebauten or \\\"communal buildings\\\", or where the city government provides funding to not-ยญfor-ยญprofit deveยญlopers to build rent-ยญcontrolled flats. Both are available to people below a certain income level; the Gemeindebauten apartments don't require a deposit, while the rent-ยญcontrolled flats sometimes do require deposits of between โฌ10,000 and โฌ20,000, which are returned when the tenant moves out.\\n\\nAt the moment, Gemeindebauten and rent-ยญcontrolled flats are available for people with an annual net income of less than โฌ79,490 in a two-ยญperson household, which is almost โฌ30,000 more than Austria's average income. There's no shame in renting these places - even people on fairly decent incomes regard it as a chance to live well at an affordable rent. Apparently Gemeindebauten and rent-ยญcontrolled flats are even better than private housing in some respects, including playgrounds, community rooms and community gardening.\\n\\nThe Netherlands, in particular Amsterdam, has an absolutely dire housing crisis, with the median price now more than 10 times income. By the end of 2023 the average Dutch house cost โฌ452,000, versus the average salary of โฌ44,000. House prices have more than doubled in the past decade and in some areas have risen 130%. Rents are โฌ1,500 to โฌ3,000 a month - almost as much as in Sydney!\\n\\nThe reason the Netherlands is in such a pickle is something Australians well understand: the government has been stimulating demand while not doing anything about supply.\\n\\nAcademic Gregory Fuller of Groningen University said recently: \\\"The key features of the housing crisis - rising prices, increasing inequality, shortages of affordable homes and foreign investors infiltrating the market - are the result of decades of dubious housing policies.\\\"\\n\\nA pro-ยญmarket Dutch government in effect abolished the housing and planning ministry in the early 2010s and freed up sales of housing corporation stock. Partly as a result, about 25% of homes in the country's four big cities are owned by investors. Further driving up prices are measures such as mortgage tax relief for buyers, and others - meant to aid young buyers - that have instead ended up helping existing owners invest in more property. At the same time, subsidies for house building all but dried up.\\n\\nAfter far-ยญright politicians such as Geert Wilders blamed migrants and asylum seekers for the crisis, a special rapporteur for the United Nations, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, visited the Netherlands and said Dutch government policy choices were to blame for the country's housing crisis, not asylum seekers or migrant workers. \\\"An alternative narrative has emerged in the Netherlands that an 'influx of foreigners' is responsible,\\\" Rajagopal said. The crisis - of both affordability and availability - had, he added, been \\\"two or more decades\\\" in the making. Among other factors, he blamed a lack of regulation of social housing providers, an absence of rent caps in the private sector and \\\"insufficient attention to the role of speculation and large investors in the real estate market\\\".\\n\\nSound familiar? Well, the proposed solutions will sound familiar as well. The government aims to build 900,000 new homes by 2030, but construction is beยญยญhind schedule. They've also brought in regulations to make renting more secure for tenants and are looking into rent control options.\\n\\nThe house building incentive scheme provided โฌ1bn in grants to municipalities to get them to build more houses; however, a report by the Netherlands court of audit cast some doubt on whether this would lead to more housing being built quickly enough. Nevertheless, the new government plans to press on and allocate another โฌ1bn to the scheme.\\n\\nIn 2022, a law was passed banning buyers of homes below a certain value from renting them out, aimed at increasing housing supply for owner-ยญoccupiers. But this reduced the number of rental properties and pushed up rents.\\n\\nOverall, it's probably fair to say the Dutch are at their wits' end, a bit like Australians.\\n\\nHome prices in Colorado increased sixยญfold in 30 years, outstripping both Florida and California, for the usual reason: demand was greater than supply. Seniors were staying in their houses longer, investors were buying second homes and short-ยญterm rentals, and millennials were trying to break into the housing market in increasing numbers.\\n\\nThen, on 13 May 2024, Colorado governor Jared Polis signed a bill requiring local governments to plan and zone for more apartments and condominiums near transit stations. On the same day, he signed another law allowing accessory dwelling units - small apartments located on the same lot as a single-ยญfamily house - to be constructed in large cities and towns. These bills followed others that eliminated minimum vehicle parking requirements for apartments and preยญempted local rules prohibiting people from living with roommates. These changes will make housing more affordable by allowing developers to build more - and more diverse - housing at a lower cost.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"theguardian.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"The Guardian\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Homeowners\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Homeowners\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Restoration\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Restoration\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Business\",\"label\":\"news/Business\",\"wgt\":60}],\"image\":\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b064f11ef2e9dac7e4c66a148778c175d169571/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=3fba16a16b234f9f5372dee8c319f378\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":92},\"sentiment\":-0.1843137254901961,\"wgt\":465177696,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398042\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:01:38\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:38Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:10Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.6352941393852234,\"url\":\"https://theprint.in/india/ukhand-communal-tension-erupts-in-dehradun-after-muslim-girl-found-hanging-with-hindu-boy/2287859/\",\"title\":\"U'khand: Communal tension erupts in Dehradun after Muslim girl found hanging with Hindu boy\",\"body\":\"The girl had allegedly fled her home to meet the boy who works in the Selaqui area near here, he said.\\n\\nUpon reaching Dehradun, she called the boy who came to meet her at the railway station.

White residents also carry about $100 more in debt than residents of color in Washington, a trend that's reversed nationwide.\\n\\nOnly 1% of Washington residents hold delinquent medical debt, opposed to 5% of the nation. Thirteen percent of Washington residents have past-due student loan debt and 3% carry auto or retail loan debt, rates that are both 2% lower than the national average.\\n\\nYoung adults in Washington also have less past-due debt than the national average for young adults. Both Washington's young adults and the nation's are less likely to have unpaid debt than older adults.\\n\\nDelinquency can lead to high fees, increased interest rates, poor credit scores and more, hurting a person's ability to access car and home loans, rent apartments and pay for other living expenses.\\n\\nThe analysis from the public policy think tank uses August 2023 credit bureau data and Census estimates from 2018 to 2022. In its definition of delinquent debt, it includes unpaid bills in collections and past-due credit lines that have been closed and charged off.\\n\\nThat definition may obscure the true levels of debt Washington residents face, said Sam Hatzenbeler, a policy associate at Economic Opportunity Institute, a progressive non-profit group based in Seattle. Medical debt, for example, can come from other sources, like needing to go on a payment plan with a hospital or getting a loan from a friend.\\n\\nA Kaiser Family Foundation report with a broader definition of medical debt using 2019-2021 data found 6.5% of Washington residents have medical debt -- but that number was still comparatively better than the national average in the same report.\\n\\nHatzenbeler said Washington may be doing better compared to the rest of the nation due to policy changes to improve affordability of needed services, like expanding Medicaid. But she said that doesn't mean there isn't still an \\\"affordability crisis\\\" in Washington.\\n\\nThe interactive dashboard reveals county-level rates of delinquent debt as well, showing that rates of debt in all of Washington's 39 counties are lower than the national average.\\n\\nYakima County and Asotin County have the highest rate of debt at 20%.

And making sure they have a healthy, filling breakfast only adds to the challenge. That's why pediatricians feed their kids a few protein-packed nutritious breakfasts on repeat.\\n\\n\\\"Mornings are always a scramble,\\\" Dr. Danielle Grant, a pediatrician at Texas Children's Pediatrics and mom of three teenagers, tells TODAY.com. \\\"As a parent, you're always struggling to make sure they're getting what they need at probably the busiest time in the morning for everybody,\\\" she says.\\n\\nWhen her kids were younger, Grant navigated their picky toddler tastes. And now that they're older, \\\"they wake up and they're busy, they're not hungry and they're trying to rush out the door because they overslept,\\\" she says.\\n\\nBut breakfast doesn't have to be part of the morning's obstacle course. Instead, it can be an opportunity to involve kids in picking and making their meals. And breakfast creates a way to start the whole family's day on the right foot, experts say.\\n\\n\\\"I really am a firm believer in the egg sandwich,\\\" Dr. Christina Johns, a senior medical adviser for PM Pediatrics, tells TODAY.com.\\n\\nHer kids, ages 15 and 18, are both athletes who prefer a hot breakfast, so they gravitate towards protein-packed egg and cheese sandwiches most mornings. The sandwiches are a great option, Johns says, because they contain protein, dairy, fiber and carbs -- and have the potential to be customized with other nutritious ingredients.\\n\\nSometimes her kids will have their sandwiches on \\\"fancy seven-grain panini bread,\\\" she says. Or they might use a flour tortilla or croissant, and the variety helps keep the meal interesting.\\n\\nJohns also encourages her kids to add other nutritious ingredients to their sandwiches, like avocado or cooked veggies leftover from dinner the night before.\\n\\nFruit is always a health ingredient to add to any meal, and some fruits are more portable than others. For instance, it might not be convenient to sit down with a knife and fork for a slice of watermelon or cantaloupe in the mornings, Johns says.\\n\\nInstead, she \\\"tries to do things that are easy\\\" and offers her daughter a banana or a ramekin of berries, like blackberries or blueberries, that she can just grab and eat in the carpool on the way to school.\\n\\nSometimes, children's preferences change quickly. So it helps to have a few standard food options that you can easily adapt to their changing tastes.\\n\\nThat's how Dr. Katie Lockwood, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, approaches breakfast with her kids. Her go-to foods are typically high in filling protein. \\\"I know (protein) will keep them full longer and help give them energy for their busy day,\\\" Lockwood says.\\n\\nIf they're having baked goods, like a muffin or croissant, she encourages them to have a glass of milk, too, for some protein. And if they're eating a waffle, they smear it with cream cheese or peanut butter.\\n\\nKnowing that mornings don't leave much time for cooking, Grant tries to \\\"make a game plan the night before,\\\" which often includes making hard-boiled eggs. That way, her kids can eat the eggs the next day however they want (which often means topping them with everything bagel seasoning.)\\n\\nIf she does happen to have time in the morning, Grant might make poached eggs over whole-grain toast with some avocado.\\n\\nAmy Reed, a registered dietitian at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, typically makes homemade muffins for her two teenage sons.\\n\\n\\\"I really like to increase the nutritional value of muffins by adding pureed pumpkin, banana, peach, applesauce or carrots,\\\" she says.\\n\\nShe also uses some whole wheat flour rather than entirely white flour because it has more vitamins, minerals and fiber. But she usually only substitutes half because her kids don't like the muffins when they're entirely whole wheat. \\\"I try to keep their preferences in mind,\\\" she explains.\\n\\nAlongside the muffins, Reed encourages her kids to drink milk for some protein. Sometimes she'll steer them towards ultrafiltered milk, which has more protein than regular milk.\\n\\nA balanced dinner includes filling protein, heart-healthy fats and energizing carbohydrates -- along with a good helping of vegetables. All of those things make leftovers the perfect meal to eat in the morning, too!\\n\\n\\\"There's no shame in dinner for breakfast,\\\" Dr. Shelly Vaziri Flais, a Chicago-based pediatrician and editor-in-chief of the American Academy of Pediatrics' \\\"Caring For Your School-Age Child,\\\" tells TODAY.com.\\n\\nA mom of four kids, including twins, Flais always makes extra spaghetti and meatballs so her kids can have it for breakfast the next morning. \\\"You've got your protein, and with the tomato sauce, you get some vitamin C in there,\\\" she says. \\\"And it's something a little bit more substantial to carry them through the day.\\\"\\n\\nWhile it's not routine for everyone in the family, Johns says her daughter enjoys heating up the previous night's dinner, such as chicken and rice, for breakfast. \\\"It sounds perfectly awful to me,\\\" Johns says, but the meal contains healthy, lean protein so she goes along with it.\\n\\n\\\"If she's in the mood for chicken with pesto at 9:15 a.m. in the summertime, which she has been recently, more power to her,\\\" she says.\\n\\nTo get more protein in the mornings, Reed will sometimes make her kids fruit-filled protein smoothies.\\n\\nOne of her go-to recipes includes strawberries, a splash of lemonade with some Greek yogurt, ultrafiltered milk or a bit of protein powder. She'll also sneak in some other fruit occasionally or even a peeled cucumber because \\\"it's such a hydrating vegetable.\\\"\\n\\nGrant also gives her kids protein smoothies in the morning, especially if they're not super hungry but still need to eat something before school.\\n\\n\\\"We like to do a lot of fruit in ours and then a nice source of protein, like peanut butter,\\\" she says. Their favorite recipe is made with banana (which Grant usually freezes ahead of time), milk, peanut butter and chocolate. But they also like strawberries and banana blended with a bit of vanilla protein powder.\\n\\nFor a more filling twist on a classic breakfast, Flais turns to high-protein waffle mix.\\n\\nShe buys the mix in bulk and, taking a tip from a fellow parent, she adds extra ingredients to further increase the protein content. \\\"Instead of water, you add milk,\\\" she explains, \\\"and then you add an egg for each cup of the mix.\\\"\\n\\nThe result is a quick meal that's packed with protein and fiber. Flais often makes the waffles for a weekend breakfast, and her kids eat the leftovers the next morning.\\n\\nAnd for a fiber-rich twist on yet another classic breakfast food, the experts recommend making pancakes with whole-grain ingredients.\\n\\nPancakes are relatively quick to make in the morning, Reed says, and offer another opportunity to sneak in some nutrition via gut-healthy whole grains, fruit and applesauce. Johns also makes buckwheat pancakes, which her kids like to eat with banana slices and maple syrup.\\n\\nThe experts say they generally don't make any breakfast foods completely off-limits. But some are saved for weekends when the family can all enjoy the meal together or they're paired with other, more nutrient-dense foods during the week.\\n\\n\\\"I try not to restrict particular foods,\\\" Lockwood says, \\\"but rather advise them that they need to eat things that will help them have energy and the ability to focus throughout the day.\\\"\\n\\nFor instance, if the child is having something like the occasional breakfast pastry, Reed says she'll encourage them to also have something else -- like a smear of peanut butter on a croissant or eggs on the side with a donut -- to help keep them full.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think we should focus too much on whether or not something is a right or wrong breakfast food, but rather let kids choose things that make them feel good,\\\" Lockwood says. Reed also notes that her kids are old enough to start making connections on their own between what they eat and how they feel or how well they perform at after-school swim meets.\\n\\nThe experts try not to let their kids leave home in the morning without eating something.\\n\\nDepending on when kids normally have lunch, they may be able to get away with something smaller in the morning, like a glass of milk or a granola bar, Reed says, noting that some school lunches can be as early as 10 a.m.\\n\\nBut if they're having lunch later in the afternoon, then it's a good idea for them to have something more substantial, like peanut butter and jelly in a tortilla on the way to the bus, Reed suggests, or a smoothie, Lockwood says.\\n\\nEating a regular breakfast, along with water, is also important for gastrointestinal health, Flais says. \\\"I see so many young children with abdominal pain and constipation issues, and part of that is eating infrequently or eating a ton at once and then not much at other times of the day,\\\" she explains.\\n\\n\\\"Parenting is hard, and a struggle over breakfast can set a negative tone for your and your children's day,\\\" Lockwood says.\\n\\nJohns, who had a tough time getting one of her kids to eat breakfast when they were younger, encourages parents to give themselves grace when challenges arise around eating.\\n\\nLockwood agrees: \\\"If you are offering a variety of foods throughout the day and your child is growing well, don't worry if your child's breakfast isn't as much or as varied as you want it to be,\\\" she adds. \\\"Model eating a variety of foods yourself, and use breakfast as a time to chat and bond with your child before the day ahead.\\\"\\n\\nGrant and Johns also suggest involving kids in meal prep. For younger kids, Johns recommends prompting them to pick out the specific berries they want to eat. And for older kids, Grant says her daughter likes to find \\\"trendy recipes\\\" on social media sites, like Nutella french toast, and make them for breakfast on the weekends.\\n\\n\\\"They get invested in making it, and it becomes a fun little activity for the family,\\\" Grant says.\\n\\nFlais also encourages parents to get kids involved in choosing, making and even shopping for food. \\\"It helps your child feel connected and more invested in taking ownership over their own health,\\\" she says, \\\"which I think is a pretty cool thing.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"yahoo.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Yahoo\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Vegetarianism\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Vegetarianism\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Cooking/For_Children\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Cooking/For Children\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Veganism\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Veganism\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Food_and_Drink\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Food and Drink\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Health\",\"label\":\"news/Health\",\"wgt\":99}],\"image\":\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Qd24kWV7wTGugIMMJTD7fQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_today_217/066306e3681a9db696cbc320b9185ce1\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9944905\",\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1,\"pinterest\":1},\"sentiment\":0.1607843137254903,\"wgt\":465177701,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398687\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:01:41\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:41Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:16Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.7254902124404907,\"url\":\"https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/food/1953137/How-to-keep-pumpkins-fresh-longer-hack\",\"title\":\"Pumpkins 'last 2 to 3 months' when kept in right place - if carved use this item\",\"body\":\"If you're already feeling in the Halloween mood and have already bought your pumpkins to decorate the house, you might want to use some storage hacks to help keep them from rotting before the October 31 celebration.\\n\\nWhether you've harvested your own pumpkins or picked one up from the store or the pumpkin patch, knowing how to store them can extend their life significantly.\\n\\nFresh pumpkins can thrive at room temperature for about a month and can last even longer -- up to three months -- if kept in a cool, dark, and dry environment.\\n\\nAlmanac readers also provided tips for carved pumpkins, with one simple yet unusual hack helping preserve them from the inside.\\n\\nWhen it comes to pumpkin carving, timing is crucial; a carved pumpkin typically lasts only three to seven days, especially in warm weather.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"express.co.uk\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"EXPRESS\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"melanie_kaidan@express.co.uk\",\"name\":\"Melanie Kaidan\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning_and_Stains\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning and Stains\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Arts_and_Entertainment\",\"label\":\"news/Arts and Entertainment\",\"wgt\":47}],\"image\":\"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/14/1200x630/5649638.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9947626\",\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.3725490196078431,\"wgt\":465177701,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398040\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:01:44\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:44Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:00:10Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://theprint.in/india/woman-murders-jilted-lover-with-boyfriends-help-in-ghaziabad/2287862/\",\"title\":\"Woman murders 'jilted' lover with boyfriend's help in Ghaziabad\",\"body\":\"The deceased's father, Kishore Sharma, alleged in his police complaint that his son was killed by Rani, 20, and her accomplice Raju Thapa, 22.

I certainly know a lot of the people over there, I know a lot of the players over there, but I think there's been enough distance at this point.\\\"\\n\\nStearns joined the Brewers in October 2015 as general manager and was promoted to president of baseball operations before the 2019 season. He stepped down after the 2022 season and remained with the Brewers in an advisory role while Matt Arnold -- his former right-hand man -- took over as president of baseball operations. Stearns left Milwaukee entirely last fall to run baseball operations for the team he rooted for as a kid growing up in New York City.\\n\\nHe believed this was his first time back at American Family Field since August 2023. The Brewers opened the season by sweeping the Mets in New York, but the teams hadn't faced each other since.\\n\\nNow they're meeting again with the Mets' season on the line. New York entered Friday just ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks for the second of three National League wild cards, with the Atlanta Braves one game behind both.\\n\\nAs Stearns noted, the Brewers' roster has changed quite a bit since he departed. Milwaukee's starting lineup Friday included only four players -- second baseman Brice Turang, right fielder Sal Frelick, left fielder Jackson Chourio and shortstop Willy Adames -- who joined the organization when Stearns was in charge.\\n\\nEven so, Stearns played a major role in helping the Brewers put together the longest sustained run of success in franchise history. Milwaukee clinched the NL Central title last week and will be making its sixth playoff appearance in the last seven years. That run of postseason bids came shortly after Stearns engineered the blockbuster acquisition of Christian Yelich, the 2018 NL MVP.\\n\\nMilwaukee had made the playoffs just twice in a 35-year stretch from 1983-2017.\\n\\n\\\"It's fun being back here,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"I'm glad I'm back here when games really matter for us. We're playing for something that's really important, so we have to go out and have a good series.\\\"\\n\\nStearns is now trying to get back in the playoffs with the Mets, which could result in a return to Milwaukee next month. But that path just got quite a bit more complicated.\\n\\nThe Mets face the possibility of playing a doubleheader in Atlanta on Monday -- the day after the scheduled end of the regular season -- for the right to begin a Wild Card Series on Tuesday. That scenario developed because New York's scheduled Wednesday and Thursday games in Atlanta were rained out.\\n\\n\\\"Nobody wants to play a doubleheader on Monday,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"The Braves didn't want that outcome, MLB didn't want that outcome and certainly we didn't want that outcome. I think it's easy in retrospect to say that we could have done things differently to get there. It's also really tough in the moment to predict exactly what the weather is going to do. There are a whole host of considerations that everyone is working through in order to make the best decision possible.\\n\\n\\\"The reality is we may have to play a doubleheader on Monday, and if we do, we'll do the best that we can.\\\"\\n\\nStearns was asked if he believed the start of a Wild Card Series should be pushed back a day if that Monday doubleheader takes place. The twinbill would only happen if the Mets' and Braves' playoff fates aren't settled by then.\\n\\n\\\"That's not my decision, and so I'm not really thinking about it,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"Whenever we play, we play.\\\"\\n\\nIf New York ends up as the third NL wild card, Stearns would be seeing his former team again with even more at stake as the Mets and Brewers square off in a best-of-three series.\\n\\n\\\"Our focus is on to get into the playoffs,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"If we get into the playoffs, we'll play whoever we need to play.\\\"\\n\\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB\\n\\nSteve Megargee, The Associated Press\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"timescolonist.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Times Colonist\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Sports\",\"label\":\"news/Sports\",\"wgt\":85}],\"image\":\"https://www.vmcdn.ca/files/victoriatimescolonist/images/static-images/tc-flag-crest.png\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.09019607843137245,\"wgt\":465177709,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398817\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:01:49\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:49Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:30Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.thephinsider.com/2024/9/27/24255905/phinsider-victory-of-the-week-open-thread-vol-603\",\"title\":\"Phinsider Victory Of The Week Open Thread Vol. 603\",\"body\":\"It's Friday, so it's time for us to welcome you to another VOTW post.

This fruit improves overall visual function by supporting healthy blood circulation to the eyes and enhances the health of the retinal blood vessels.

These nutrients work synergistically to fight off age-related eye issues, making huckleberry a vital component of Vision Pro Max.\\n\\nFind Similar Best Eye Health Supplements Today!

It plays a pivotal role in protecting eye cells from oxidative stress, which can lead to serious conditions like cataracts and macular degeneration. Quercetin also enhances blood circulation to the ocular area, ensuring that the eyes receive essential nutrients for optimal function. With its ability to neutralize free radicals, quercetin enhances overall eye health, making it a critical ingredient in Vision Pro Max.\\n\\nZeaxanthin is a carotenoid found in high concentrations within the retina. It serves as a natural filter for harmful blue light, mitigating the damage that can lead to oxidative stress in the eyes. Protecting retinal cells from this type of damage is crucial for maintaining healthy vision and reducing the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Furthermore, zeaxanthin works in tandem with lutein to improve visual acuity and overall eye health, making it an indispensable part of the Vision Pro Max formula.\\n\\nNiacin, also known as vitamin B3, is essential for maintaining healthy blood flow and ensuring the proper functioning of nerve cells in the eyes. By enhancing blood circulation, niacin aids in delivering crucial nutrients to eye tissues while reducing inflammation. This vitamin is also instrumental in energy production, which is vital for eye cell health. By including niacin in its formulation, Vision Pro Max provides a comprehensive approach to eye health that combines protection with nourishment.\\n\\nShop Top Sellers!

Known for its anti-inflammatory properties, eyebright helps alleviate irritation and redness, promoting overall eye comfort. It especially benefits individuals who experience eye strain due to prolonged screen time or environmental factors. By incorporating eyebright into the formula, Vision Pro Max protects the eyes and enhances comfort, leading to clearer vision and improved visual well-being.\\n\\nVitamin A is crucial in maintaining healthy vision, particularly in low-light conditions. It is essential for producing rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina responsible for night vision. Moreover, sufficient vitamin A levels can help prevent dry eyes and support overall ocular health. Its inclusion in Vision Pro Max ensures that users receive the necessary nutrients to maintain optimal vision, especially as they age.\\n\\nVitamins C and E are powerful antioxidants that protect eye cells from oxidative stress. Vitamin C helps maintain the health of ocular blood vessels, while vitamin E plays a role in preventing cataracts and age-related eye diseases. Together, these vitamins enhance the body's natural defense against environmental stressors, making them vital components of Vision Pro Max. Their synergistic effect contributes significantly to this eye health supplement's overall efficacy and quality.\\n\\nZinc is critical for transporting vitamin A from the liver to the retina, where it is converted into melanin, a protective pigment for the eyes.

The 40-year-old Sam -A was looking to capture the 374th win of his long and storied career. He had suffered a bad knockout loss his last time out back in June 2023 so this was a big test for the aging veteran.\\n\\nIt didn't take long for Sam-A to win the battle of spacing and create an opportunity to deliver another finish to add to his insanely long resume. After about 70 seconds of action, Sam-A uncorked a vicious left cross that caught Hamidi flush and sent him crashing to the canvas. Hamidi was completely out so the referee immediately stepped in for the stoppage.\\n\\nCheck it out in the above video player.\\n\\nWhile the one-punch knockout was memorable in its own right, the fact that this was Sam-A's 374th victory of his career is even more insane.

White residents also carry about $100 more in debt than residents of color in Washington, a trend that's reversed nationwide.\\n\\nOnly 1% of Washington residents hold delinquent medical debt, opposed to 5% of the nation. Thirteen percent of Washington residents have past-due student loan debt and 3% carry auto or retail loan debt, rates that are both 2% lower than the national average.\\n\\nYoung adults in Washington also have less past-due debt than the national average for young adults. Both Washington's young adults and the nation's are less likely to have unpaid debt than older adults.\\n\\nDelinquency can lead to high fees, increased interest rates, poor credit scores and more, hurting a person's ability to access car and home loans, rent apartments and pay for other living expenses.\\n\\nThe analysis from the public policy think tank uses August 2023 credit bureau data and Census estimates from 2018 to 2022. In its definition of delinquent debt, it includes unpaid bills in collections and past-due credit lines that have been closed and charged off.\\n\\nThat definition may obscure the true levels of debt Washington residents face, said Sam Hatzenbeler, a policy associate at Economic Opportunity Institute, a progressive non-profit group based in Seattle. Medical debt, for example, can come from other sources, like needing to go on a payment plan with a hospital or getting a loan from a friend.\\n\\nA Kaiser Family Foundation report with a broader definition of medical debt using 2019-2021 data found 6.5% of Washington residents have medical debt -- but that number was still comparatively better than the national average in the same report.\\n\\nHatzenbeler said Washington may be doing better compared to the rest of the nation due to policy changes to improve affordability of needed services, like expanding Medicaid. But she said that doesn't mean there isn't still an \\\"affordability crisis\\\" in Washington.\\n\\nThe interactive dashboard reveals county-level rates of delinquent debt as well, showing that rates of debt in all of Washington's 39 counties are lower than the national average.\\n\\nYakima County and Asotin County have the highest rate of debt at 20%. In Yakima County, 23% of the county's residents of color are carrying delinquent debt as opposed to 14% of white people. Data for communities of color in Asotin County is unavailable.\\n\\nThe lowest rate of debt is in Kittitas County, at 10%.\\n\\nDisparities for communities of color in Washington are most apparent in the state's most populous counties, with Pierce County being the worst: 29% of the county's residents of color have delinquent debt, compared to 16% of the county's white residents. In King County, 8% of white residents have delinquent debt, compared to 15% of residents of color.\\n\\n-\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"rentonreporter.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Renton Reporter\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Personal Finance\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Older_Citizens\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Older Citizens\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Business\",\"label\":\"news/Business\",\"wgt\":79}],\"image\":\"https://www.rentonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/37489459_web1_debt-i_1.jpeg\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":-0.2313725490196078,\"wgt\":465177720,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398820\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:02:01\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:02:01Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:30Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.7647058963775635,\"url\":\"https://www.timescolonist.com/real-estate/renewed-optimism-in-reits-as-interest-rates-soften-says-colliers-9576078\",\"title\":\"Renewed optimism in REITs as interest rates soften, says Colliers\",\"body\":\"Dividends and diverse assets make sector attractive to some retail investors\\n\\nThe last three months have seen a recovery in the value of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), with sentiment improving as investors anticipate further interest-rate cuts and seek broad exposure to high-quality commercial real estate.\\n\\nThere is renewed interest in REITs as investors seek income from their portfolios. Deal-making within the sector due to better financing terms could boost returns even more, said Adam Jacobs, head of research with Colliers Canada.\\n\\n\\\"It's been an area that's been very hard-hit in the last year because of interest-rate hikes, but it really seems to have turned the corner,\\\" said Jacobs. \\\"The last three months have seen a recovery in the value of REITs, with interest-rate cuts coming and investors not feeling so down on real estate.

The 22-year-old multi-talented phenom moved up three levels in the farm system, ending the Minor League season in Triple-A as one of baseball's most promising prospects. On Tuesday, he was named the 2024 Double-A Eastern League MVP and Baseball America's Prospect of the Year, an accolade he'd also received from The Athletic's Keith Law the week before. On Wednesday, chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said Campbell and Roman Anthony are two top prospects whom the Red Sox would consider putting on next year's Opening Day roster.\\n\\nThat's where things stood on Friday afternoon, when Campbell visited Fenway Park for the first time, to receive the organization's Minor League Offensive Player of the Year award.\\n\\n\\\"It's really cool, it's really exciting,\\\" he said as he stood by the Red Sox dugout. \\\"Couldn't ask for more.\\\"\\n\\nOver 115 games between High-A Greenville (40 games), Double-A Portland (56), and Triple-A Worcester (19), Campbell slashed .330/.439/.558 with 142 hits, 32 doubles, and 20 home runs. He scored 94 runs, drove in 77 RBI, stole 24 bases, drew 74 walks, and struck out 103 times.\\n\\nThat's the final tally on an offensive campaign that Campbell said \\\"started off a little bit slow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"(Swinging) a little bit too hard sometimes, trying to get my feet under me,\\\" Campbell said. \\\"I think I found an even balance when I got to Portland, and just kind of kept going from there.\\\"\\n\\nThough Campbell said he had \\\"really high expectations\\\" for himself coming into the season, even he was surprised by his power surge. He'd hit four home runs over 45 games for Georgia Tech in 2023, and homered once in the 22 games he played between rookie level and High-A after the Red Sox drafted last summer.\\n\\n\\\"I think it was definitely more than what I expected coming into the season, because I've never really like, hit home runs before,\\\" Campbell said. \\\"If you asked me before the season if I would have hit - told me I would have hit 20 home runs, no. No way.\\\"\\n\\nCampbell modestly credited the organization's development staff for helping him unlock his power.\\n\\n\\\"The work the development team has for me and what we work on every day, kind of gets me prepared for that,\\\" he said. The work that I put in, definitely, it showed this year.\\\"\\n\\nTeammates clearly agreed. Campbell realized that they were calling him \\\"Barry\\\" after the famed (controversial) slugger Barry Bonds, whose 762 career home runs stand atop MLB's all-time list.\\n\\n\\\"We were in the locker room, and they just started kind of calling me 'Barry,' and I'd never answer because I didn't know what they were talking about,\\\" Campbell explained. \\\"They kept doing it for like, two or three days, and I started answering, and the nickname just kind of stuck.\\\"\\n\\nConcerns over where Campbell fits into the current Red Sox defense are virtually nonexistent. He's incredibly versatile, and confident in his abilities to move around.\\n\\n\\\"I play everywhere pretty well. I play middle infielder, center, I can play the corners, too, and a little bit of third base. I feel pretty comfortable everywhere on the field,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm primarily a middle infielder and I feel really comfortable at second base, that's been my spot the last couple years. This year I moved all over the place and I felt really good.\\\"\\n\\nIt's something that impressed Triple-A manager Chad Tracy immediately.\\n\\n\\\"Second baseman, maybe, third baseman, maybe centerfielder, short. He probably could play any one of them at this point,\\\" Tracy said at the end of August. \\\"He covers ground out there (in the outfield). ... At short, he looks smooth, really smooth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just a good athlete. A good athlete who has versatility, he can impact the baseball,\\\" said manager Alex Cora on Friday. \\\"We're very pleased with the season he had, obviously putting himself on the radar. He worked hard for it, and he's an interesting player, and a good one.\\\"\\n\\nCampbell is no stranger to Green Monsters. The organization's spring training facility in Fort Myers has a replica, as do two of the three levels Campbell played at this year.\\n\\nBut nothing compares to the original verdant behemoth in Boston, which Campbell got to see for the first time on Friday.\\n\\n\\\"It's good, it's big! We had it in Greenville and Portland,\\\" he said. \\\"This one's definitely a little bigger, and it's a lot brighter.\\\"\\n\\nHow fitting for a season, and future, bigger and brighter than he expected.\\n\\nTwo of Boston's top prospects, shortstop Marcelo Mayer and outfielder Braden Montgomery, finished the season on the injured list, but Red Sox director of player development Brian Abraham provided a positive update on both prior to Friday's game.\\n\\n\\\"Marcelo is doing well, he's back home progressing really well,\\\" Abraham said of Mayer, the No. 10 ranked prospect in MLB according to Baseball America. \\\"He'll soon be ramping up baseball activity but a full offseason of health and preparation for next year's spring training.\\\"\\n\\nMayer was promoted to Triple-A in August but was shut down due to a lumbar strain before playing a game in Worcester. Meanwhile, Montgomery, who was drafted No. 12 overall by the Red Sox out of Texas A&M in this summer's draft, suffered a broken ankle in the NCAA Tournament and has been recovering ever since.\\n\\nAbraham said Montgomery has been on a strength and conditioning program and recently started swinging, and the expectation is he'll remain in Fort Myers for the time being as he keeps working on his rehab.\\n\\n\\\"We're really excited to see him get on the field and the progress he's going to make,\\\" Abraham said.\\n\\nMontgomery currently ranks as the No. 59 prospect in MLB despite still having yet to make his pro debut.\\n\\nThe Salem Red Sox, based out of Salem, Virginia, have served as a Single-A affiliate for Boston since 2009, but with the club's lease at Salem Memorial Stadium due to expire following the season, questions have lingered about the club's future.\\n\\nThough a new lease hasn't been signed, Peter Freund, CEO of club owner Diamond Baseball Holdings, said Friday that they expect a deal will be reached and that the franchise will remain in Salem.\\n\\n\\\"We are in discussions with the City of Salem on lease drafts and intend to enter into a new lease prior to the 2025 season,\\\" Freund told the Herald.\\n\\nThe Salem Red Sox currently serve as Boston's Low-A affiliate in the Carolina League.

That left his company without a legal representative in the country, a federal requirement for all tech platforms to do business there.\\n\\nBy Aug. 28, de Moraes' court threatened a ban and fines if X didn't appoint a legal representative within 24 hours, and if it didn't comply with takedown requests for accounts the court said had engaged in plots to dox or harm federal agents, among other things.\\n\\nEarlier this month, the STF froze the business assets of Musk companies, including both X and satellite internet business Starlink, operating in Brazil. The STF said in court filings that it viewed Starlink parent SpaceX and X as companies that worked together as related parties.\\n\\nMusk wrote in a post on X at that time that, \\\"Unless the Brazilian government returns the illegally seized property of and SpaceX, we will seek reciprocal seizure of government assets too.\\\"\\n\\nAs head of the STF, de Moraes has long supported federal regulations to rein in hate speech and misinformation online. His views have garnered pushback from tech companies and far-right officials in the country, along with former President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters.\\n\\nBolsonaro is under investigation, suspected of orchestrating a coup in Brazil after losing the 2022 presidential election to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\\n\\nWhile Musk has called for retribution against de Moraes and Lula, he has worked with and praised Bolsonaro for years. The former president of Brazil authorized SpaceX to deliver satellite internet services commercially in Brazil in 2022.\\n\\nMusk bills himself as a free speech defender, but his track record suggests otherwise. Under his management, X removed content critical of ruling parties in Turkey and India at the government's insistence. X agreed to more than 80% of government take-down requests in 2023 over a comparable period the prior year, according to analysis by the tech news site Rest of World.\\n\\nX faces increased competition in Brazil from social apps like Meta-owned Threads, and Bluesky, which have attracted users during its suspension.\\n\\nStarlink also faces competition in Brazil from eSpace, a French-American firm that gained permission this year from the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) to deliver satellite internet services in the country.\\n\\nLukas Darien, an attorney and law professor at Brazil's Facex University Center, told CNBC that the STF's enforcement actions against X are likely to change the way large technology companies will view the court.\\n\\n\\\"There is no change to the law here,\\\" Darien wrote in a message. \\\"But specifically, big tech companies are now aware that the laws will be applied regardless of the size of a business and the magnitude of its reach in the country.\\\"\\n\\nMusk and representatives for X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\\n\\nLate Thursday, X Global Government Affairs posted the following statement:\\n\\n\\\"X is committed to protecting free speech within the boundaries of the law and we recognize and respect the sovereignty of the countries in which we operate. We believe that the people of Brazil having access to X is essential for a thriving democracy, and we will continue to defend freedom of expression and due process of law through legal processes.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"nbcnewyork.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"NBC New York\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Law\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Law\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Technology\",\"label\":\"news/Technology\",\"wgt\":89}],\"image\":\"https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/09/108029884-1725558601274-gettyimages-2169508169-dealmeida-notitle240903_npdN4.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.3725490196078431,\"wgt\":465177729,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398660\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:02:16\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:02:16Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:11Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.4549019634723663,\"url\":\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/threads-joins-x-in-blocking-posts-to-apparently-leaked-documents-about-jd-vance/\",\"title\":\"Threads joins X in blocking posts to apparently leaked documents about JD Vance\",\"body\":\"Threads is blocking links to an article that may contain links to leaked documents about JD Vance.

According to a rudimentary internet search, Dr. Pradelle had never published before. Subsequently, listed authors were degreed as physicians, pharmacists, and/or professors of their respective disciplines. The main, corresponding author, Jean-Christophe Lega, runs the Evaluation and Modeling of Therapeutic Effects team at the University of Lyon.\\n\\nIn addition to being a hypothesized estimate, the article also attacked the legendary safety of HCQ, contradicting centuries of the safety of quinolines as a class.\\n\\nHCQ, chloroquine and quinine are structurally and pharmaceutically/mechanistically related, sharing the same quinoline structural group. The original iteration of quinine was a very fortunate discovery that dates back to the 1600s (at least) as a medicinal tipple used by Jesuit missionaries in South America. It is naturally found in the bark of the Cinchona tree (also called a \\\"Quina-Quina\\\" tree).\\n\\nQuinine is still available today both as a prescription drug, for similar indications as HCQ including malaria...and as a Covid-19 treatment.\\n\\nQuinine is so safe that it may be unique in that the FDA simultaneously permits its use without a prescription, as an ingredient in tonic waters.\\n\\nHCQ is similarly safe when used appropriately and under medical supervision.\\n\\nThese are pharmacology fundamentals that ought to be known by any pharmacist or physician - let alone to a professor serving as a Journal Editor-in-Chief at a taxpayer-funded state College of Pharmacy.\\n\\nDid not even one person on her editorial board of over 50 \\\"peer-reviewers\\\" and staff ponder the celebrated and storied history of HCQ (and its predecessors) and how incongruent this study's findings were before choosing to publish data denigrating HCQ safety?\\n\\nThe correct answer to that might actually be: \\\"no\\\"...\\n\\nThe publishing editorial board all seem to be laboratory bench (non-clinical) research scientists, per their biographies. Although the board does promote itself as meeting DEI requirements of being \\\"gender diverse,\\\" a more important question might be is if they have the appropriate credentials and experience to review and opine on clinically complex drug safety/epidemiology subject matters in the first place.\\n\\nIs just anyone now allowed to opine on specialty clinical pharmacology drug safety matters?\\n\\nIn certain journals/news publications, the answer to that question seems to be: \\\"yes\\\"...\\n\\nAnother point of confusion surrounded the interpretation and promotion of this little-known publication by the lay press.\\n\\nTo be exact: there were never \\\"17,000 deaths;\\\" it was always a hypothetical extrapolation of people that could have died, based on \\\"unreliable\\\" (eg, actually, fraudulent) databases on top of the previously mentioned, problematic late-stage RECOVERY-trial-type dosing and timing.\\n\\nStill, Josh Cohen, a Forbes.com PhD senior healthcare columnist, used this publication to headline an absurdly biased op-ed against HCQ, stating that Trump's HCQ proposal was \\\"Linked To 17,000 Deaths.\\\" Forbes' Tufts, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania- trained \\\"healthcare analyst\\\" misrepresented or appeared to not understand the now-retracted study methodology or projections.\\n\\nHere are some screenshots of headlines referencing non-existent deaths based on a now-retracted study:\\n\\nAlmost immediately following the January 2, 2024 publication, its critical flaws including basic miscalculations among many other deficiencies were brought to the attention of Dr. Townsend by Xavier Azalbert and non-profit BonSens.org attorneys starting on Jan 7, 2024. In fact, a total of 9 communications were sent by the above individuals, but none of them were ever shared as \\\"Letters to The Editor\\\" by Dr. Townsend in good faith to inform readers of specific potential shortcomings, as is otherwise commonly done.\\n\\nDr. Townsend seemed to forget that bad medical data and publications can do actual patient harm, and kept legitimate and important study criticisms to herself. Instead of taking responsibility and making a leadership decision, she passed the buck to a Committee on Publication Ethics, delaying the needed retraction.\\n\\nIt appallingly took 234 days (~7 months, from the January 2nd publication to August 26th) for Dr. Townsend's Journal of Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy to finally retract the \\\"unreliable\\\" article. But at that point, untold millions around the world had already been (and continue to be) polluted with outrageously incorrect information about non-existent HCQ deaths.\\n\\nEthical scientists who believe in truth, transparency, and academic accountability are standing by, waiting for medical and academic justice.\\n\\nUnethical scientists are also watching this situation unfold, twisting their mustaches, learning about what they could potentially one day get away with.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"conservativeangle.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Brigitte Gabriel\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Health\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Issues/Health\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Specific Substances\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Publications\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Publications\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Health\",\"label\":\"news/Health\",\"wgt\":82}],\"image\":\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Shutterstock_1406984654-2-1536x900.jpg?itok=CsptZZ8h\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.2549019607843137,\"wgt\":465177742,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340399270\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:02:26\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:02:26Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:02:05Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.7215686440467834,\"url\":\"https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/nation_and_world/nation/photo-collection-mexico-first-woman-president/article_7527bf2e-85ea-526d-9e0c-4f9fbeeab569.html\",\"title\":\"PHOTO COLLECTION: Mexico First Woman President\",\"body\":\"FILE - Claudia Sheinbaum raises a fist as she is driven away from a polling station where she voted in the general elections in Mexico City, June 2, 2024.

Bluth and his talented teams produced the animated classics The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go to Heaven, and Anastasia, as well as such video games as Dragon's Lair. Recently, Bluth published Yuki, Star of the Sea, the first book in a planned series of children's fables. BookLife named it an Editor's Pick and praised Bluth's illustrations. We spoke to Bluth about creativity, his writing, and the message behind the book.\\n\\nMany of your projects place you as an artist first. How has your relationship to writing evolved over the years?\\n\\nI am, by nature, blessed with a driving curiosity, particularly when it comes to the nature of mankind. My dad was a policeman in El Paso, Texas. He spoke often about what makes people behave as they do: nurture or nature?\\n\\nI've always been an artist, one who pursued anything beautiful. That was my God-given talent, and it came naturally. I drew as I pleased. In college, I stayed away from the art department. I resolved to find my own way in that regard. So what did I do? I majored in English. I had no idea what I was getting into at the time, but suddenly I was overwhelmed with reading assignments, and although it was exhausting, it opened up a whole new world.\\n\\nOver the years, I began to see that my drawings were void of any meaning, but the messages in the books I read were not. I put the two worlds together. My new approach to art went far beyond being just cute or anatomically correct or a wonderful graphic design. Every drawing became a metaphor or a simile for an idea.\\n\\nIs there a character that you've created who you feel resonates just as easily with people today as they did when they were created?\\n\\nOh my, yes. I'm thinking of Dirk the Daring from the 1980s video game Dragon's Lair. That spunky little knight is as dumb as a bag of hammers, yet when it comes to the challenge of rescuing the princess, Daphne, he somehow manages to win. Wasn't that the formula for [Chaplin's] the Little Tramp? What a loving character he was. I see those tendencies in my own life. What I mean is: I am both a genius and an idiot. The success of my characters, and there are thousands of them, is the fact that they reflect human nature.\\n\\nYuki, Star of the Sea is the only fiction work you've released. Is there a reason you haven't written more fiction?\\n\\nOld-fashioned animation is still my first love. However, when the computers moved in, the pencils moved out. I've spent some time being sad about this, but I'm here, and I can still communicate with my drawings. I hope 2D animation gets a renaissance, I really do. Meanwhile, I have stories in my head that need to be told and published. I will write and illustrate books.\\n\\nWhat inspired the conservation message at the heart of Yuki, Star of the Sea?\\n\\nThe Earth with its ecosystem and all its creatures that live on the planet are sacred subjects to me. Everything is beautiful in its own way, and yet death is ever-present. I am saddened by the pain and suffering that I see around me, and I refuse to be a mere witness to all that. I am here to help Mother Nature. Yuki, the little whale, belongs in the sea, and not in a tank in Mexico.\\n\\nDo you have any advice for artists today?\\n\\nYou must see yourself first as an entertainer -- one who can tell a joke and people will laugh, or one who tell can tell a story and people will smile, one who can sketch a drawing and someone wants to buy it.\\n\\nInside each of us is a creative light that wants to shine. If your light is about creating characters with a pencil, then you must do more than simply want it. When I draw, I never settle for just okay. And, if it turns out to be not okay, I keep drawing until it is. I know this sounds like work, but it's the only way, and you can apply this rule to any medium.\\n\\nThe book's subtitle is \\\"A Don Bluth Fable.\\\" Can readers expect more fables in the future?\\n\\nFunny that you should ask. Currently, I have eight books on the board. Although I am now in the autumn of my years, that creative light inside me shines on. My joy comes from seeing people smile.\\n\\nDrucilla Shultz is a bookseller and freelance editor with over a decade of publishing industry experience.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"publishersweekly.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"PublishersWeekly.com\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Arts_and_Entertainment\",\"label\":\"news/Arts and Entertainment\",\"wgt\":95}],\"image\":\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/images/data/ARTICLE_PHOTO/photo/000/114/114278-1.JPG\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.3098039215686275,\"wgt\":465177747,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340399316\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:02:28\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:02:28Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:02:08Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0.5058823823928833,\"url\":\"https://www.fool.ca/2024/09/27/this-tsx-dividend-stock-pays-5-in-monthly-cash/\",\"title\":\"This TSX Dividend Stock Pays 5% in Monthly Cash\",\"body\":\"One of the most coveted elements of investing is receiving a dividend. That being said, not all stocks pay a dividend, and fewer can pay their dividends on a monthly cadence. Fortunately, there is one TSX dividend stock that pays a monthly dividend to consider right now.\\n\\nThat stock is Exchange Income Corporation (TSX:EIF) and here's why you should invest in Exchange right now.\\n\\nMost investors aren't aware of Exchange or more specifically, how lucrative an investment Exchange is. For those unfamiliar with the stock, Exchange is an acquisition-focused company with over a dozen subsidiary companies.\\n\\nThose subsidiaries are broadly classified into two segments comprising aviation and manufacturing. Both segments have two key features in common that are worth mentioning to prospective investors.\\n\\nFirst, all of those subsidiaries generate free cash for the company. This is important because it allows Exchange to invest in growth initiatives while also paying out a juicy monthly dividend.\\n\\nThe second point to note is that the subsidiaries provide a necessary service across the niche markets they serve. Often, these have no or extremely limited competition, which provides an element of appeal.\\n\\nThis not only provides a defensive moat for the company, but can be a lucrative source of revenue\\n\\nBy way of example, let's look at the aviation segment. Exchange's subsidiaries there provide passenger, cargo, and medevac service to the remote regions of Canada's north. Turning to the manufacturing segment, examples include custom manufacturing services for the defence market as well as cell tower fabrication services.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons why investors flock to Exchange is for that lucrative monthly payout. As of the time of writing, Exchange offers a juicy 5.5% yield. This makes the TSX dividend stock one of the better-paying options to consider right now.\\n\\nThat tasty yield also means that investors with $30,000 to invest can expect to earn $125 every month from Exchange. Even better, investors who aren't ready to draw on that income yet can choose to reinvest that dividend. This allows it to grow further over a longer period of time.\\n\\nSpeaking of growth, Exchange continues to provide annual generous upticks to that dividend. In fact, the company has provided increases to that monthly cash dividend for 17 of the last 19 years.\\n\\nThat fact alone makes Exchange a great buy-and-forget TSX dividend stock to consider for your portfolio.\\n\\nNo stock even the most defensive is not without some risk, and that includes Exchange. Fortunately, Exchange is a well-diversified option that can provide years of opportunity for growth and income-seeking investors alike.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Exchange should be a core holding as part of any long-term well-diversified portfolio.\\n\\nBuy this TSX dividend stock today, hold it, and watch it (and your future income) grow.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"fool.ca\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"The Motley Fool Canada\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"demetris_afxentiou@fool.ca\",\"name\":\"Demetris Afxentiou\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Investing\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Investing\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Business\",\"label\":\"news/Business\",\"wgt\":84}],\"image\":\"https://www.fool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Slide-8.jpg\",\"eventUri\":\"eng-9938900\",\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.1450980392156862,\"wgt\":465177748,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398992\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:02:28\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:02:28Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:44Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/sexual-assault-sentence-arapahoe-county-colorado/73-1a0a4b4f-6ae0-4987-9ce0-08e4bca53a52\",\"title\":\"Man who sexually assaulted woman at gunpoint sentenced to 30 years\",\"body\":\"CENTENNIAL, Colo. -- Editor's note: The story below includes details about a sexual assault that readers might find disturbing.\\n\\nA man accused of sexually assaulting a woman in her car at gunpoint was sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison.\\n\\nHilton Acker, 34, pleaded guilty in July to second-degree kidnapping in Arapahoe County court as part of a plea agreement. Court records show a sentence enhancer of using a weapon in a violent crime was proven.\\n\\nIn January 2023, the victim said she was driving on South Alton Street between East Mississippi Avenue and East Florida Avenue, which is near Aurora, when she was flagged down by a man she did not know.\\n\\nShe reported to police that the man was waving and holding a cup of coffee. She pulled over and the man began knocking on the passenger side window, the arrest affidavit says. She rolled down the window, and the man pointed a gun at her.\\n\\nHe told her to open the door, which she said she did out of fear for her safety. She said he ordered her to drive, and after about five minutes, they ended up in alley, where the victim reported that the man forced her to perform a sex act on him at gunpoint, the affidavit says.\\n\\nShe reported that afterward, the man got into the front seat and drove them around for about 30 minutes before stopping.\\n\\nShe reported that the man raped her in the back seat. She said they drove to a neighborhood where the man stole her phone and ran from the vehicle, the affidavit says.\\n\\nShe said she drove out of the neighborhood to find a gas station to ask for directions because she did not know where she was and arrived home about 5 a.m.\\n\\nInvestigators later spoke with the victim's partner, who said he was working as a bartender until about 3:30 a.m. He reported that she had stopped texting him around 2:30 a.m. and was crying when she got home and immediately went to take a shower.\\n\\nWhen she got out, she told him what happened, the affidavit says.

It's taken me countless hours, many pointless side quests and one Merlin Trial. But I enjoyed my time with it. It has too many flaws though.\\n\\nWhere do I start? Maybe the Merlin Trials being so pointless and a waste of time. I only did the one trial, when I got introduced to it, and ignored it completely after that. Why should I waste my time with expanding my gear slots when the rewards are worthless clothing items?\\n\\nHogwarts itself is just a beautiful centrepiece but there's no requirement at all to actually be there or even bother with it. You can skip days, skip classes, and even journey further away from it. There are no consequences at all and the castle itself is littered with stairs, lifeless students, and repeating lines of dialogue.\\n\\nThere's also the fact that the classes are two minutes long. You learn a new spell and that's it. You never need to worry about it ever again. You spend more time carrying out assignments outside of Hogwarts than attending classes, or even caring about Hogwarts.\\n\\nSummoner's Court is a waste of time. The duelling club is five minutes long and is never brought up again. You can't attend the feasts. Even the end of year feast is locked off to you. There're no house points. The Unforgivable Curses are pointless. You can cast Crucio as many times as you like. Azkaban is an afterthought. No consequences at all. There's more. The fact that Quidditch was saved for another game and more cash to pay for it is shameful.\\n\\nThe rewards for every dungeon is just more clothing items. The Forbidden Forest is just filled with the same types of enemies. Spiders. Trolls. Poachers. They just come across as bullet sponges and that applies for the trolls. They become tedious tasks and it just gets boring.\\n\\nThe enemies repeat the same lines and even characters such as Harlow and Rookwood are extremely boring. Their fights are less than five minutes long. The final fight is just boredom. Even the professors are just forgettable.\\n\\nThe beasts aspect of the game is pointless. It only serves to introduce Poppy, and I do like her, but she's only there for her questline and then forgotten about. Same for Natty and Sebastian. Sebastian was my favourite companion in the game, but I know his story is finished and I'll never be able to speak to him again. There's also the fact that the common rooms are more pointless than Hogwarts itself. You travel there for the first time and it just becomes absolutely worthless.\\n\\nIt's empty as hell, you can't even sleep in your own bed and there's no motivation to even visit the common room. It looks nice and it's a great introduction to the three best Slytherin characters: Ominis, Imelda, and Sebastian. I loved all three of them and I was proud of choosing Slytherin as my house. But that was ultimately a waste of breath because you're locked down as the hero of Hogwarts and you can't actually be evil.\\n\\nLike I mentioned before, there's no consequences and no one is phased by you knowing and using Avada Kedavra. Only Sebastian faces the consequences. I didn't actually expose him and that wasn't an issue because it never gets brought up again. Just a final conversation with him. That's it.\\n\\nI've said enough but this was a good game. It could have been great. I hope Avalanche takes the criticisms on board because I'd be glad to see a sequel and continue the journey of my character named Marguerite Vasilisa.\\n\\nAlso, on a final note. You don't even take your O.W.L.s. So, you'll never know your career path. But you win the House Cup. Which is pointless. So that's something.\\n\\nBy reader Shahzaib Sadiq\\n\\nThe reader's features do not necessarily represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"metro.co.uk\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Metro\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Arts_and_Entertainment\",\"label\":\"news/Arts and Entertainment\",\"wgt\":87}],\"image\":\"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SEI_221102244-18c7.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C38px%2C1920px%2C1008px&resize=1200%2C630\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":-0.1607843137254902,\"wgt\":465177748,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340399071\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:02:29\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:02:29Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:54Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.publishersweekly.com:443/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/96040-richard-price-s-true-grit.html\",\"title\":\"Richard Price's True Grit\",\"body\":\"Despite his success -- bestselling books, awards, film adaptations, critical acclaim -- Richard Price, who typically works seven days a week, admits he doesn't enjoy writing all that much.\\n\\n\\\"If someone could give me a pill that would make me unconscious and my head would fall on a piece of paper and, when I came to, lo and behold, there was a manuscript here, that would be great,\\\" Price, dressed in a white button down, says via Zoom from his desk at the top of the Harlem brownstone where he's lived since 2008. \\\"But there's no such pill.\\\"\\n\\nPrice writes about social issues around violence, drugs, race, and identity with unparalleled precision, and counts James Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain and Lenny Bruce's stand-up among his early influences. His nine previous novels -- including The Wanderers, his 1974 debut about a Bronx gang; Clockers, a seminal book about cops and crack dealers in fictional Dempsey, N.J., which became a Spike Lee movie; and Lush Life, a crime story set on the Lower East Side in the early aughts -- have been translated into more than 15 languages. His screen credits include The Color of Money, for which he received an Academy Award nomination, and the HBO series The Night Of.\\n\\nAnd while he continues to juggle books and scripts, he insists, \\\"I'm a novelist first, no matter how many screenplays I write.\\\" His new novel, Lazarus Man (FSG, Nov.), is his first in nearly 10 years. It's a big-canvas novel about second chances and lost love that's also one of his most sensitive. Set in 2008 in East Harlem, it focuses on four characters whose lives are impacted by the collapse of a tenement building that kills several inhabitants and leaves others missing.\\n\\nPrice was born in the Bronx in 1949 and grew up in a housing project, where he was nicknamed Mr. Vocabulary. He has cerebral palsy -- the result of a breech birth -- a condition that affected his muscles and has left him with limited use of his right hand. \\\"My grandma used to say, 'Okay, you're a little bit of a cripple, but goddamn you have a mind on you, boy,'โ\\\" Price says. \\\"If my hand wasn't messed up, I don't know if I would've been a writer. It made me an outsider.\\\"\\n\\nAfter receiving his BA from Cornell University in industrial labor relations in 1971, Price told his parents he wanted to get an MFA in writing. \\\"They freaked out,\\\" he says. \\\"They said, 'What are you going to do, drive a cab while you're thinking of a poem?'โ\\\" While working toward his MFA at Columbia University, he wrote furiously, and by the time he graduated in 1976, he'd published two novels.\\n\\nIn the early '80s, Price began writing screenplays to make extra money and developed a cocaine addiction that lasted several years. \\\"I'd write 100 great pages on coke, but they were for 100 different projects,\\\" he recalls. \\\"It was a low time.\\\" In 1984, he married his first wife, then got sober and had two daughters. The pair divorced in 2010, and, in 2012, Price married novelist Lorraine Adams, whom he calls his \\\"raw-hearted twin.\\\"\\n\\nAs Price's screenwriting career kicked into gear in the late '80s, he hit the streets for inspiration. While writing the 1989 movie Sea of Love, he started going on ride-alongs with cops -- something he continued to do when he returned to novels in the '90s. \\\"I don't want to write; I want to talk to people,\\\" Price says of doing field research for his projects. \\\"It's my social life.\\\"\\n\\nDavid Simon, creator of The Wire, used Clockers as inspiration for his hit HBO series, for which Price became a writer. \\\"Clockers read like The Grapes of Wrath for the '80s cocaine epidemic,\\\" Simon says. \\\"Richard is a vacuum cleaner when it comes to any world he's trying to create. If he's writing about cops, they're the realest cops you've ever heard talk. His milieu has often been crime, but he's a literary writer. I was always a little enamored of him.\\\"\\n\\nPrice's dialogue -- whether New York cop-speak or street slang -- is evocative and witty, while his artful explorations of human nature are windows into worlds beyond our own. Both are clearly on display in Lazarus Man. In the wake of the tenement collapse, the novel follows Anthony Carter, an unemployed former addict who's pulled from the rubble and becomes a media sensation, all the while hiding a secret; Mary Roe, a cop obsessed with finding one of the missing residents; Felix Pearl, a mixed-race photographer searching for his \\\"true tribe\\\" in a gentrifying Harlem; and Royal Davis, a funeral parlor owner who hopes the collapse will generate business.\\n\\nAs the book unfolds, Price tenderly explores the emotional lives and romantic entanglements of his characters. Mary struggles to navigate a platonic relationship with her ex-husband while dating a man who wants more than she can give. Anthony falls for a woman from the neighborhood, exposing himself to rejection and pain.\\n\\nA real-life building collapse in 2014 near Price's home sparked the idea for Lazarus Man, his first work set in Harlem. \\\"When that building fell, I felt it in my jawbone -- the boom, the vibrations -- and I was down there in half an hour, picking up this POV, that POV,\\\" Price says. \\\"If I'd written about Harlem the first year after I moved here it would've sounded like a Popeye travelogue. But after a while, when the amazing becomes normal, when your eyes and mind calm down, that's when you pick up on nuances. Sometimes, you can go to the corner store for mint Milanos and come back with a chapter. It's just living.\\\"\\n\\nIt's these keen powers of observation that, according to Price's editor, Jonathan Galassi, make him an artist. \\\"He's very perceptive,\\\" Galassi says. \\\"He writes about the city from a vernacular point of view and knows it from the inside.\\\"\\n\\nAnd while Price is known for his gritty work, his agent, Lynn Nesbit, describes him as a one-of-a kind novelist with a gentle touch. \\\"For all the rough and tumble of his books, there's a sensitivity to Richard that often doesn't get mentioned,\\\" Nesbit says. \\\"He's incomparable.\\\"\\n\\nThese days, Price is more content with life than ever. He recently became a grandfather, and despite those grumblings about wanting a magic writing pill, he's having fun and growing as a writer. \\\"Nobody thinks about it, but fun is so important,\\\" he says. \\\"You never want to stop being a student, and I still have that eagerness to learn.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"publishersweekly.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"PublishersWeekly.com\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Arts_and_Entertainment\",\"label\":\"news/Arts and Entertainment\",\"wgt\":100}],\"image\":\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/images/data/ARTICLE_PHOTO/photo/000/114/114277-1.JPG\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":1},\"sentiment\":0.07450980392156858,\"wgt\":465177749,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340395090\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:02:30\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:02:30Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-27T23:54:10Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/jensen-design-build-launches-inaugural-234900693.html\",\"title\":\"Jensen Design Build launches inaugural Homebuyers University in Mitchell\",\"body\":\"Sep. 27 -- MITCHELL -- Jensen Design Build is set to host the inaugural Homebuyers University on Tuesday, Oct. 1, at Bradley's Pub and Grille in Mitchell. This educational event aims to demystify the complex process of home buying, offering a comprehensive overview for prospective buyers and builders.\\n\\nThe free, two-hour session will equip attendees with essential knowledge about the local real estate market and the intricacies of purchasing a home.\\n\\nJeremy Jensen, founder of Jensen Design Build, explained the motivation behind the event.\\n\\n\\\"We get asked some of the same questions on a daily basis by customers. We came up with Homebuyers University as a way to educate future potential homebuyers on what to expect throughout the home building process,\\\" Jensen said.\\n\\nThe event is designed for anyone interested in homeownership, whether they are first-time buyers or those considering custom-built homes.\\n\\nThe curriculum will cover various aspects of the homebuying journey. Attendees will gain insights into financing options, including understanding different mortgage types and programs available for various buyer situations. They will also learn about the step-by-step building procedure, providing a detailed look at what to expect during construction. Lot selection strategies will be discussed, helping participants choose the right location and land for their new home. Budgeting techniques will be covered to assist attendees in effectively managing their finances throughout the buying process.\\n\\nAdditionally, there will be discussions on the pros and cons of model/spec homes versus custom-built residences, giving insights into ready-to-move-in homes compared to personalized builds tailored to individual preferences.\\n\\nA key speaker at the event will be Cory Marek from Plains Commerce Bank, who will discuss financing options tailored for different buyer needs. He will highlight programs specifically designed for first-time homebuyers and veterans through Veterans Administration loans. Jensen noted that his business is one of only a few VA approved builders in the state.\\n\\nThe timing of this event is particularly significant given the current housing market dynamics.\\n\\nAccording to data from Zillow, the median home listing price in South Dakota has increased by approximately 26%, adjusted for inflation, from the second quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2024. This translates to an increase of about $75,000, with prices peaking at around $375,000 in February 2023. Despite these increases, Jensen believes that housing in South Dakota remains relatively affordable compared to national trends. The typical home price in the state is $308,851 -- 15% lower than the U.S. average -- which could be appealing for potential buyers looking for value.\\n\\nJensen feels the housing industry in South Dakota has always been strong.\\n\\n\\\"I've always been happy with the amount of building that's been happening in South Dakota and in the area,\\\" he said.\\n\\nJensen acknowledges that the housing industry has faced some negative publicity in recent years, but attributes this to changing perceptions rather than a fundamental lack of affordability.\\n\\n\\\"Housing is affordable. It always has been affordable. But the perception of what I can afford is what has changed,\\\" Jensen explained.\\n\\nJensen believes that as prices and rates have increased, many people have had to reassess their needs and wants when it comes to housing.\\n\\nRecent trends suggest a potential stabilization in the housing market. Mortgage rates have declined from last year's high of 7.79% to an average of about 6.22% for a 30-year fixed loan.\\n\\nJensen notes this shift has renewed interest among prospective buyers, and many individuals who previously delayed their home-buying decisions are now exploring their options again.\\n\\n\\\"Those who hesitated over the past few months are now reaching out to us,\\\" Jensen said.\\n\\nWhile the event is primarily focused on new construction home buyers, Jensen encourages all potential homebuyers to attend, regardless of their current stage in the home-buying process. The event will feature a roundtable format designed to foster interactive discussions among attendees.\\n\\n\\\"This is an inclusive event designed for everyone, from entry-level buyers to those looking at custom homes,\\\" Jensen said. \\\"The Homebuyers University is an opportunity to learn, ask questions, and connect with industry professionals who can guide you.\\\"\\n\\nJensen Design Build's commitment extends beyond Mitchell to surrounding rural communities, including Corsica, Gregory, Parkston, Chamberlain, Huron and Howard. The company collaborates with local development groups to ensure access to affordable housing options in these areas.\\n\\nBy bringing new housing developments to smaller towns, they aim to make homeownership more attainable for residents outside urban centers.\\n\\n\\\"We want to help communities grow by providing quality housing that meets the needs of local residents,\\\" Jensen said.\\n\\nHe noted that their efforts are focused on understanding the unique challenges faced by these smaller towns and tailoring solutions that fit their specific circumstances.\\n\\nFor more information or to RSVP, interested parties can visit\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"yahoo.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"Yahoo\"},\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Home Improvement\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Homeowners\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Homeowners\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Home/Apartment Living\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Business\",\"label\":\"news/Business\",\"wgt\":89}],\"image\":\"https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{},\"sentiment\":0.2,\"wgt\":465177750,\"relevance\":1},{\"uri\":\"8340398935\",\"lang\":\"eng\",\"isDuplicate\":false,\"date\":\"2024-09-28\",\"time\":\"00:02:31\",\"dateTime\":\"2024-09-28T00:02:31Z\",\"dateTimePub\":\"2024-09-28T00:01:37Z\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"sim\":0,\"url\":\"https://sanjosespotlight.com/election-2024-longtime-california-politico-sally-lieber-could-land-santa-clara-county-board-of-supervisors-district-5-seat/\",\"title\":\"Election 2024: Longtime politico could land Santa Clara County D5 seat - San Josรฉ Spotlight\",\"body\":\"Don't miss a story.\\n\\nGet San Josรฉ Spotlight headlines delivered to your inbox.\\n\\nSally Lieber jumped into politics at age 13, rallying in Detroit for former Michigan state Sen. Doug Ross between delivering newspapers. She caught the political bug early, and since then has held numerous posts in California. This November she wants to add another achievement to her lengthy resume: Santa Clara County supervisor.\\n\\nLieber, 63, is competing against Mountain View Councilmember Margaret Abe-Koga for the open District 5 seat on the Board of Supervisors, with Supervisor Joe Simitian terming out this year. Lieber and Abe-Koga were the top vote getters advancing after the March primary election. District 5 includes Mountain View, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Palo Alto and a small section of San Jose.\\n\\nLieber expected more people with political experience to vie for the job, and when that didn't happen she knew she had to run. If elected in November, her move from the California State Board of Equalization, a tax administration agency, to county supervisor couldn't be more different. Lieber represents about 10 million state residents where she votes on tax issues. If elected supervisor, she would represent around 392,500 residents in one county and decide on local issues ranging from health care to jails.\\n\\nNo problem, she said. Lieber's motto has always been: \\\"I can be dangerous anywhere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I may not win, but I am a master at (this). I'm a master policymaker and I'm a master campaigner,\\\" she told San Josรฉ Spotlight. \\\"I'm now so much stronger than I was in the past.\\\"\\n\\nLieber's political career spans multiple stretches with the Mountain View City Council, getting her start as a Stanford University undergraduate student studying public policy. She also attended San Francisco City and Foothill colleges. After her first successful city council run where she served from 1998 to 2002, she was elected to the state Assembly from 2002 to 2008 and appointed Democratic speaker pro tempore from 2007 to 2008. She authored a bill to raise California's minimum wage from $6.75 to $8 an hour over about two years -- a difficult endeavor under Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\n\\nLieber's priorities for supervisor include homelessness and affordable housing, health care and mental health and affordable child care. She supports safe parking and sanctioned encampment sites for homeless residents, but said the county and its cities need to provide more permanent housing after people are placed in temporary housing sites.\\n\\nAs someone who has struggled with depression, she plans to examine the inpatient bed needs at mental health facilities and incentivize residents to use mental health services at hospitals. She aims to strengthen existing services and programs already funded rather than throwing money at new ones, using her past experience.\\n\\n\\\"It's really exciting to me to look at the tie-in (between county and state),\\\" she said. \\\"Even though I'm out of the Legislature, I've continued to have bills, some signed by governors, so I think there's a real crossover that's powerful.\\\"\\n\\nLieber's path to government was atypical. She moved to San Francisco from Michigan in her 20s to pursue opportunities in the building industry, her whole life packed in her car. She said she was often the only woman in the room. After moving to politics, she spent three years helping refugees in Greece from 2015 to 2018, traveling to and from the country.\\n\\nDespite Lieber's unusual career, locals have paid attention to her.\\n\\nFormer Mountain View Mayor Lenny Siegel has endorsed and encouraged Lieber's run for supervisor after nearly two decades of knowing her. He said Abe-Koga isn't as supportive of housing justice as Lieber, who supported his referendum against restrictions on people living in RVs.\\n\\n\\\"We really need leaders who will step up and make the hard decisions,\\\" he told San Josรฉ Spotlight. \\\"Simitian did it and we need somebody to take his place who will continue to do it.\\\"\\n\\nCalifornia State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, San Jose Councilmembers Domingo Candelas and Peter Ortiz and the South Bay Progressive Alliance have also endorsed Lieber.\\n\\nPalo Alto resident Forest Peterson, a Stanford University civil and environmental engineering research affiliate, spends his weekends knocking on doors for Lieber. He said both candidates could be role models for his daughters as strong women in power, but he thinks Lieber is better for Stanford.\\n\\n\\\"She's got the street cred, where she's put shoes on the ground,\\\" he told San Josรฉ Spotlight.\\n\\nLieber said her career has been a long journey, which she hopes to continue as a supervisor.\\n\\n\\\"I just feel like for a little girl from Detroit who delivered that many newspapers before school and after school and everything, I'm doing pretty well,\\\" she told San Josรฉ Spotlight. \\\"I get to be in these great offices doing real things. It's super exciting.\\\"\",\"source\":{\"uri\":\"sanjosespotlight.com\",\"dataType\":\"news\",\"title\":\"San Josรฉ Spotlight\"},\"authors\":[{\"uri\":\"annalise_freimarck@sanjosespotlight.com\",\"name\":\"Annalise Freimarck\",\"type\":\"author\",\"isAgency\":false}],\"categories\":[{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"dmoz/Health/Nursing/History\",\"label\":\"dmoz/Health/Nursing/History\",\"wgt\":100},{\"uri\":\"news/Politics\",\"label\":\"news/Politics\",\"wgt\":95}],\"image\":\"https://sanjosespotlight.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/23172405/381381449_10159789043147263_3775514300888880950_n-1200x630.jpg\",\"eventUri\":null,\"shares\":{\"facebook\":8},\"sentiment\":0.03529411764705892,\"wgt\":465177751,\"relevance\":1}]}}\n"

Despite having a confirmed documented criminal history, ICE released them into the United States.\\n\\nLechleitner notes that some local jurisdictions \"have reduced their cooperation with ICE, to include refusal to honor ICE detainer requests, even for noncitizens who have been convicted of serious felonies and pose an ongoing threat to public safety\" due to their so-called \"sanctuary city\" policies. \"However, \\'sanctuary\\' policies can end up shielding dangerous criminals, who often victimize those same communities,\" he said.\\n\\nBecause of local jurisdictions refusing to cooperate with ICE, the agency lifted detainers for 24,796 known criminals and released them into the U.S., he said. The data is from Oct. 1, 2020, through July 22, 2024.\\n\\nAmong them, state and local law enforcement agencies refused to comply with 23,591 detainer requests; 1,205 detainer requests were lifted \"due to insufficient notice to ICE.\"\\n\\nAlso during this period, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations issued 2,897 detainers that were declined by state or local law enforcement agencies even after the subject of the detainer request had a subsequent apprehension by ICE ERO, according to the report.\\n\\nMore from this section Plane contrails: white fluffy contributors to global warming Kenya set for full Haiti deployment amid call for shift to UN mission Swiss central bank cuts rate again amid strong franc worries\\n\\nLechleitner also notes that \"most noncitizens who are convicted of homicide are typically not eligible for release from ICE custody under ยง236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\" but \"ICE officers may use their discretion in making custody determinations and release noncitizens with conditions.\" He says these determinations are made on a \"case-by-case basis.\"\\n\\nIn response, U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green, R-TN, said, \"It may be shocking to hear that the Biden-Harris administration is actively releasing tens of thousands of criminal illegal aliens into our communities, but their own numbers conclusively prove this to be the case.\\n\\n\"This defies all common sense. Under President Biden and his \\'border czar,\\' Vice President Harris, DHS law enforcement has been directed to mass-release illegal aliens whom they know have criminal convictions or are facing charges for serious crimes - and these dangerous, destructive individuals are making their way into every city and state in this country. How many more Americans need to die or be victimized before this administration is forced to abide by the laws they swore to uphold?\\n\\n\"This is madness. It is something no civilized, well-functioning society should tolerate.\"\\n\\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said the number was \"shocking.\"\\n\\n\"If accurate, it means that almost 10%\" of the criminal illegal foreign nationals released into the country by the Biden-Harris administration \"are criminals. It also debunks the narrative that illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crime. We can\\'t survive four more years of this.\"\\n\\nMore than 387,000 criminal noncitizens were arrested by ICE ERO agents in fiscal years 2021 through 2023, The Center Square first reported.\\n\\nThe majority arrested were citizens of Mexico, Nicaragua, Columbia and Venezuela.\\n\\nThe majority of arrests occurred in Dallas and Houston, Texas, according to an ICE online statistical dashboard. The most common arrests are of those convicted of DUIs, drug possession, and assault and criminal (non-civil) traffic offenses like hit-and-run or leaving the scene of an accident, ICE says.\\n\\nAdditionally, a separate data point shows that U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol apprehensions of criminal noncitizens totaled nearly 54,000 since fiscal 2021, according to CBP data as of Sept. 16. The majority were for illegal entry and reentry and DUIs.',\n",

Despite having a confirmed documented criminal history, ICE released them into the United States.\\n\\nLechleitner notes that some local jurisdictions \"have reduced their cooperation with ICE, to include refusal to honor ICE detainer requests, even for noncitizens who have been convicted of serious felonies and pose an ongoing threat to public safety\" due to their so-called \"sanctuary city\" policies. \"However, \\'sanctuary\\' policies can end up shielding dangerous criminals, who often victimize those same communities,\" he said.\\n\\nBecause of local jurisdictions refusing to cooperate with ICE, the agency lifted detainers for 24,796 known criminals and released them into the U.S., he said. The data is from Oct. 1, 2020, through July 22, 2024.\\n\\nAmong them, state and local law enforcement agencies refused to comply with 23,591 detainer requests; 1,205 detainer requests were lifted \"due to insufficient notice to ICE.\"\\n\\nAlso during this period, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations issued 2,897 detainers that were declined by state or local law enforcement agencies even after the subject of the detainer request had a subsequent apprehension by ICE ERO, according to the report.\\n\\nMore from this section Plane contrails: white fluffy contributors to global warming Kenya set for full Haiti deployment amid call for shift to UN mission Swiss central bank cuts rate again amid strong franc worries\\n\\nLechleitner also notes that \"most noncitizens who are convicted of homicide are typically not eligible for release from ICE custody under ยง236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\" but \"ICE officers may use their discretion in making custody determinations and release noncitizens with conditions.\" He says these determinations are made on a \"case-by-case basis.\"\\n\\nIn response, U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green, R-TN, said, \"It may be shocking to hear that the Biden-Harris administration is actively releasing tens of thousands of criminal illegal aliens into our communities, but their own numbers conclusively prove this to be the case.\\n\\n\"This defies all common sense. Under President Biden and his \\'border czar,\\' Vice President Harris, DHS law enforcement has been directed to mass-release illegal aliens whom they know have criminal convictions or are facing charges for serious crimes - and these dangerous, destructive individuals are making their way into every city and state in this country. How many more Americans need to die or be victimized before this administration is forced to abide by the laws they swore to uphold?\\n\\n\"This is madness. It is something no civilized, well-functioning society should tolerate.\"\\n\\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said the number was \"shocking.\"\\n\\n\"If accurate, it means that almost 10%\" of the criminal illegal foreign nationals released into the country by the Biden-Harris administration \"are criminals. It also debunks the narrative that illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crime. We can\\'t survive four more years of this.\"\\n\\nMore than 387,000 criminal noncitizens were arrested by ICE ERO agents in fiscal years 2021 through 2023, The Center Square first reported.\\n\\nThe majority arrested were citizens of Mexico, Nicaragua, Columbia and Venezuela.\\n\\nThe majority of arrests occurred in Dallas and Houston, Texas, according to an ICE online statistical dashboard. The most common arrests are of those convicted of DUIs, drug possession, and assault and criminal (non-civil) traffic offenses like hit-and-run or leaving the scene of an accident, ICE says.\\n\\nAdditionally, a separate data point shows that U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol apprehensions of criminal noncitizens totaled nearly 54,000 since fiscal 2021, according to CBP data as of Sept. 16. The majority were for illegal entry and reentry and DUIs.', 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reformer.com/content/tncms/custom/image/bd63a06c-429a-11ee-8950-d704275f5abb.png?resize=600%2C315', 'sentiment': -0.5607843137254902, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340397475', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:00:05Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T23:59:24Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.news-gazette.com/angel-reese-accepting-villain-role-for-good-of-womens-basketball-backfired-on-me/article_06c03571-015c-5cb8-acdc-4f9501cd3d81.html', 'title': \"Angel Reese: Accepting 'villain' role for good of women's basketball 'backfired on me'\", 'body': 'Angel Reese said earlier this year she is willing to \"take the villain role\" in the interest of \"growing women\\'s basketball.\"\\n\\nNow, however, the Chicago Sky star feels that approach has \"backfired on me.\"\\n\\nThe WNBA released a statement Wednesday night saying it \"will not tolerate racist, derogatory, or threatening comments\" toward anyone affiliated with the league, after being called out by Connecticut Sun star Alyssa Thomas about hate speech directed toward her and other players on social media.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Reese started a series of posts on X that seemed to address the media\\'s coverage of the matter.\\n\\n\"Y\\'all know i\\'ve been going through this for the last 2 years but was told \\'save the tears\\' & \\'stop playing victim,\\'\" Reese wrote. \"Y\\'all a little late to the party and could have tried to put out this fire way before it started.\"\\n\\nIn a second post, Reese wrote: \"I\\'ve never in my life had privilege but I definitely know the power I have through my platform.

In April, Reese talked about the trash talk that went both ways between her and Clark, including the gesture Reese made toward the Hawkeyes standout during the 2023 national championship game that received widespread attention.\\n\\n\"That\\'s fine.

You either like it or you don\\'t.\"\\n\\nReese expressed a similar sentiment in June, as she and Clark were in the midst of celebrated rookie seasons that helped the WNBA\\'s popularity soar.\\n\\n\"Look where women\\'s basketball is. People are talking about women\\'s basketball that you never would think would be talking about women\\'s basketball. People are pulling up to games, we got celebrities coming to games, sold out arenas, like just because of one single game,\" Reese said, referring to the 2023 championship game.\\n\\n\"And just looking at that, I\\'ll take that role. I\\'ll take the bad guy role, and I\\'ll continue to take that on and be that for my teammates.

Mandatory Credit: Dale Zanine-Imagn Images / Dale Zanine-Imagn Images\\n\\nThe Washington Commanders will be short three players as they head to Glendale to take on the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.\\n\\nAfter making a statement in Week 3 and advancing to 2-1 on the season, the Commanders continue to look to pile momentum in the new season. They recently defeated the Cincinnati Bengals on the road during primetime behind a strong Jayden Daniels performance.\\n\\nThe rookie quarterback will be short of some help on Sunday, though. Running back Austin Ekeler and wide receiver Jamison Crowder are both designated as \"out\" for the game with their respective injuries. On the defensive side of the ball, defensive end Clelin Ferrell will be sidelined with a knee injury.\\n\\nHere\\'s how Washington\\'s last injury report before the contest played out:\\n\\nOUT:\\n\\nThe report left off a handful of players who were dealing with some sort of injury in any regard throughout the week. Offensive guard Sam Cosmi, tight end Zach Ertz, cornerback Emmanuel Forbes Jr., safety Quan Martin, cornerback Benjamin St.-Juste and defensive tackle Jer\\'Zhan Newton were all left off the report, signaling they will be good to go against the Cardinals.\\n\\nAfter missing time following thumb surgery, Forbes is back in the secondary, which should give the defense a boost. Cosmi was added to the report this week, and as Washington\\'s best offensive lineman, his absence would have certainly hurt the offense.\\n\\nThe Commanders will be without Ekeler and Crowder, but they\\'ve still got weapons and Daniels leading the way, so they should be able to rival the Cardinals well on Sunday after a somewhat hot start to the season.\\n\\nFor the Cardinals, Trey McBride and Khyiris Tonga were listed out for the game, with Kelvin Bachum and Isaiah Adams being given a questionable status.', 'image': 'https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4687,h_2636,x_1418,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/commander_country/01j8ty2dnm8b1kn4h65f.jpg', 'sentiment': 0.05882352941176472, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340397474', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:00:21Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T23:59:24Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.772549033164978, 'url': 'https://www.news-gazette.com/dylan-hern-ndez-dodgers-star-shohei-ohtani-proves-no-moment-is-too-big-for-him/article_36b7df86-567f-5dd1-88e5-79b4d84deeda.html', 'title': 'Dylan Hernรกndez: Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani proves no moment is too big for him', 'body': 'LOS ANGELES -- Shohei Ohtani isn\\'t like any other baseball player.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t about him being a two-way player when healthy or his combination of power and speed that produced the sport\\'s first 50-homer, 50-steal season.\\n\\nThis is about how he deals with career-defining moments.\\n\\nWhat\\'s at stake for his team. The implications for his legacy. The tens of thousands of people watching in person, and the millions more watching around the world. The responsibility of projecting the virtues of an entire culture.\\n\\nOther players make an effort to block out such thoughts or use them as fuel to elevate their adrenaline levels. Ohtani called them \"ingredients to heighten focus.\"\\n\\nReflecting on his seventh-inning single that drove in the go-ahead run in a 7-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on Thursday that secured the Dodgers their most recent division title, Ohtani described himself as being in a trance-like state.\\n\\n\"I was too focused to where I didn\\'t really think about being nervous,\" he said in Japanese.\\n\\nNotice what Ohtani said. He wasn\\'t just focused. He was too focused.\\n\\nWhatever he was feeling or thinking, the result was predictable. With two men on base and one out, Ohtani singled to right field against left-handed reliever Tanner Scott to drive in Kikรฉ Hernรกndez and move the Dodgers in front, 3-2.\\n\\n\"Really, I only thought about getting a hit,\" Ohtani said.\\n\\nOhtani also drove in the deciding run the previous day in a 4-3 win over the Padres in which a loss would have diminished the Dodgers\\' lead over their second-place rivals to a single game. By virtue of their head-to-head record, the Padres held the tiebreaker over the Dodgers, which means they would have won the division if they finished with the same regular-season record.\\n\\n\"No moment ever seems too big for him,\" third baseman Max Muncy said. \"When he steps in the box, you feel he\\'s going to do something special. I say it all the time: He doesn\\'t disappoint. He\\'s incredible.\"\\n\\nWhich is why the Dodgers can\\'t be counted out in October. Finally, in his seventh major league season, Ohtani will perform for the first time on the postseason stage.\\n\\nThe Dodgers don\\'t have the pitching typically required to win a World Series. This alone would eliminate most teams from being serious championship contenders, but how can any team with Ohtani not be a serious contender?\\n\\n\"I think there are some people that when the moment gets big they run from it,\" manager Dave Roberts said. \"Other guys embrace it and Shohei has embraced these moments better than any player I\\'ve ever been around.\"\\n\\nIn a sport in which exerting greater effort often produces worse results, Ohtani practically hits on command.\\n\\nThat\\'s what he did on Sunday in a comeback win over the Colorado Rockies. The Dodgers were three outs away from their lead over the Padres being reduced to two games when Ohtani led off the ninth inning with a tying home run. Mookie Betts hit a walk-off homer in the next at-bat.\\n\\nThat\\'s also what Ohtani did last year when playing for Japan in the World Baseball Classic. His team trailing Mexico in the ninth inning of their semifinal game, Ohtani started the comeback with a leadoff double.\\n\\n\"I had decided I was going to get on base no matter what,\" Ohtani said, as if that was a choice.\\n\\nJapan went on to win the tournament.\\n\\n\"You can obviously see how much he cares about winning,\" left-hander Clayton Kershaw said. \"It\\'s really fun to see the energy, especially in bigger games that we\\'ve seen recently. He really, really wants to [win] and gets excited about the possibility of postseason stuff, which is awesome.\"\\n\\nOver the course of this season, Kershaw was offered a behind-the-scenes view of how Ohtani created his on-field magic.\\n\\n\"Just from watching him, I appreciate how diligent he is,\" Kershaw said. \"He doesn\\'t ever look or say or feel like he\\'s tired. Every day is the same. He does his rehab. He does his warmup, his workout, he hits, he does his stuff, steals bases, hits homers and the next day is the exact same. I just appreciate consistency. I appreciate an attention to detail and a diligence. He does that. He does that really, really well, better than most.\"\\n\\nWhen closer Michael Kopech forced Kyle Higashioka to pop up for the final out Thursday night, Ohtani momentarily let his guard down.\\n\\nHe laughed in the clubhouse as his teammates doused him in cheap sparkling wine and beer. He emptied a bottle of Budweiser on the head of Yoshinobu Yamamoto and poured another down his back.\\n\\n\"It was the best,\" Ohtani said. \"I\\'d like to do my best so I can do it again and again.\"\\n\\nThe only other time Ohtani dumped alcohol on teammates in the wake of a season-long achievement like this, he was a 22-year-old player on the Nippon-Ham Fighters.\\n\\nThat celebration was nothing like this one.\\n\\nNot wanting to soak locker room carpets with alcohol, Japanese baseball teams stage their clinching parties off site, usually a couple of hours after the final pitch. Only beer is used, no Champagne or sparkling wine. In the case of the 2016 Fighters, they celebrated their victory in the Japan Series in an underground parking lot of a Hiroshima hotel.\\n\\nThe next day, one the country\\'s major sports newspapers featured a picture of Ohtani with goggles on his forehead, emptying a bottle of Sapporo on a teammate\\'s head. Literally and figuratively, he towered over everyone around him.\\n\\nEight years later, in the world\\'s most competitive baseball league, Ohtani once again towers over his contemporaries. He figures to increase in stature in the coming weeks. The playoffs are starting.\\n\\nยฉ2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com.

I certainly know a lot of the people over there, I know a lot of the players over there, but I think there\\'s been enough distance at this point.\"\\n\\nStearns joined the Brewers in October 2015 as general manager and was promoted to president of baseball operations before the 2019 season. He stepped down after the 2022 season and remained with the Brewers in an advisory role while Matt Arnold -- his former right-hand man -- took over as president of baseball operations. Stearns left Milwaukee entirely last fall to run baseball operations for the team he rooted for as a kid growing up in New York City.\\n\\nHe believed this was his first time back at American Family Field since August 2023. The Brewers opened the season by sweeping the Mets in New York, but the teams hadn\\'t faced each other since.\\n\\nNow they\\'re meeting again with the Mets\\' season on the line. New York entered Friday just ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks for the second of three National League wild cards, with the Atlanta Braves one game behind both.\\n\\nAs Stearns noted, the Brewers\\' roster has changed quite a bit since he departed. Milwaukee\\'s starting lineup Friday included only four players -- second baseman Brice Turang, right fielder Sal Frelick, left fielder Jackson Chourio and shortstop Willy Adames -- who joined the organization when Stearns was in charge.\\n\\nEven so, Stearns played a major role in helping the Brewers put together the longest sustained run of success in franchise history. Milwaukee clinched the NL Central title last week and will be making its sixth playoff appearance in the last seven years. That run of postseason bids came shortly after Stearns engineered the blockbuster acquisition of Christian Yelich, the 2018 NL MVP.\\n\\nMilwaukee had made the playoffs just twice in a 35-year stretch from 1983-2017.\\n\\n\"It\\'s fun being back here,\" Stearns said. \"I\\'m glad I\\'m back here when games really matter for us. We\\'re playing for something that\\'s really important, so we have to go out and have a good series.\"\\n\\nStearns is now trying to get back in the playoffs with the Mets, which could result in a return to Milwaukee next month. But that path just got quite a bit more complicated.\\n\\nThe Mets face the possibility of playing a doubleheader in Atlanta on Monday -- the day after the scheduled end of the regular season -- for the right to begin a Wild Card Series on Tuesday. That scenario developed because New York\\'s scheduled Wednesday and Thursday games in Atlanta were rained out.\\n\\n\"Nobody wants to play a doubleheader on Monday,\" Stearns said. \"The Braves didn\\'t want that outcome, MLB didn\\'t want that outcome and certainly we didn\\'t want that outcome. I think it\\'s easy in retrospect to say that we could have done things differently to get there. It\\'s also really tough in the moment to predict exactly what the weather is going to do. There are a whole host of considerations that everyone is working through in order to make the best decision possible.\\n\\n\"The reality is we may have to play a doubleheader on Monday, and if we do, we\\'ll do the best that we can.\"\\n\\nStearns was asked if he believed the start of a Wild Card Series should be pushed back a day if that Monday doubleheader takes place. The twinbill would only happen if the Mets\\' and Braves\\' playoff fates aren\\'t settled by then.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not my decision, and so I\\'m not really thinking about it,\" Stearns said. \"Whenever we play, we play.\"\\n\\nIf New York ends up as the third NL wild card, Stearns would be seeing his former team again with even more at stake as the Mets and Brewers square off in a best-of-three series.\\n\\n\"Our focus is on to get into the playoffs,\" Stearns said. \"If we get into the playoffs, we\\'ll play whoever we need to play.\"\\n\\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB', 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/news-gazette.com/content/tncms/custom/image/e462f33a-3c65-11ec-b3f1-2f038a8f66b4.jpg?resize=600%2C315', 'sentiment': 0.09019607843137245, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340395978', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:00:26Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T23:56:21Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.messenger-inquirer.com/lifestyles/entertainment/is-saturday-night-live-new-this-weekend-everything-to-know-about-season-50/article_6430e233-ac6c-5384-a7a5-ab684c722c08.html', 'title': \"Is 'Saturday Night Live' New This Weekend?

The International team returned the favor on a loud and raucous Friday at Royal Montreal by sweeping the foursomes matches and tied the Presidents Cup at 5-all. The Americans swept the opening session. This shutout by the Internationals was even more dominant. Three of the matches ended at the 14th hole or sooner.

Go ahead and Subscribe here.\\n\\nFollowing a power surge of backlash upon banning multi-plug outlets, Royal Caribbean has further clarified just exactly what type of these outlets are not permitted onboard their fleet.\\n\\nThe initial change was first noticed earlier this month when the cruise line had added multi-plug outlets to its prohibited items list, along with extension cords and power strips.\\n\\nMany cruise guests bring along these cube-style plug expanders as a way to ensure enough outlet space for charging multiple devices, plugging in CPAP machines, using hair styling tools, and otherwise giving all of their electronics ample room to connect to power.\\n\\nWhen the multi-plug outlets were first spotted on the prohibited items list, however, guest outcry was as fast as an electrical shock because of today\\'s increasing need for more outlets, especially on older ships where staterooms may only have 1-2 outlets available.\\n\\nRoyal Caribbean has further updated the prohibited items list, however, to specify one type of multi-plug outlet that is, in fact, permitted - the kind that is used as a USB charger with multiple USB outlets to connect more than one device to the same outlet.\\n\\n\"We do allow consumer type power conversion device USB charger (multi-plug blocks on which the outputs are for USB cables),\" the prohibited items list now reads.\\n\\nThis accommodation will permit travelers to use these cubes - often called USB splitters or USB hubs - to charge phones, tablets, laptops, smartwatches, and more all at once, keeping everyone connected and powered up as much as they want on their cruise vacation.\\n\\nCubes come in different styles that may feature a different number of USB outlets or USB types to work with an array of different devices or to recharge at different speeds. Some designs also permit the use of a regular plug at the same time, further ensuring that the power supply can be fully used, though those adaptations may not be fully permitted.\\n\\nCruise travelers should note that Royal Caribbean requires that any power cubes brought on board \"must be stamped with US/Europe recognized Conformance Marking to demonstrate compliance with Electrical Safety standards.\"\\n\\nRead Also: Things You Can\\'t Take on a Cruise\\n\\nThe entire reasoning for the electrical extension cord and surge protector ban is to safeguard the ship\\'s electrical system and minimize the risk of fire, so this requirement does make sense.\\n\\nUSB charger cubes are relatively inexpensive, often available in simple designs for less than $10 depending on how many charging ports are featured and what other design amenities, such as foldable prongs, are part of the product.\\n\\nCruise lines all reserve the right to prohibit a variety of items from being brought onboard their ships. Many items on the prohibited lists make sense, such as weaponry, illegal drugs, or potentially flammable chemicals.\\n\\nOther items, however, are often related to the safety of the ship, such as radios and laser pointers, which can potentially cause problems with navigation or safety alert systems.\\n\\nSome items may just seem odd - like hammers, cattle prods, and surf boards - but each one does have some logic behind it, even if most cruise travelers can\\'t quite imagine packing along such items in the first place.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the prohibited list, Royal Caribbean does note that the list is not necessary comprehensive and may be subject to change at any time or even on individual sailings.\\n\\n\"Some items that are not specifically on the list may be prohibited if they are deemed questionable by the Staff Captain and Security Officer,\" the notification reads.\\n\\nBefore setting sail with any cruise line, travelers should always check the associated prohibited items list to be sure they are in compliance with the guidelines and do not have any items confiscated as they try to board their cruise ship.\\n\\nHave you ever had an item confiscated on a cruise?

It's a sparkling melting pot of Southeast Asian culture, brimming with an ever-expanding arsenal of headline experiences. But alongside ticking off the likes of Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands, the Lion City's biggest roar is reserved for the sizzling street food scene spilling forth in the hawker centre. Singapore's harmonious multiculturalism and all its culinary influences positively sing on the plate. Come nightfall, Lau Pa Sat in downtown Singapore transforms into Satay Street, where a riot of meat on skewers and peanut sauce hold court.\\n\\nIn the interests of food hygiene, the vast majority street food stalls were kicked off the kerbside and directed indoors in the 1970s, giving birth to Singapore's legendary hawker stall culture. At last count there's now 110 hawker centres, of various sizes, pepper-potting Singapore. And they maintain a rigorous cleaning culture, where each centre closes down every three months for a 48-hour deep clean.\\n\\nHawker Food culture in Singapore. Photo / Supplied\\n\\nSingapore is also famous for being one of the few countries in the world to have its street food featured in the annually released Michelin Guide. Michelin stars generally aren't awarded to the hawker stalls because it's deemed unfair to the pricier restaurant scene given their higher operating costs. However Michelin inspectors consider the hawker cuisine so good, they award stand-out vendors with a Michelin Guide recommendation or Bib Gourmand award, which recognises high-quality, low-price food. So if you want to eat your way through Singapore, what are the must-try signature dishes and where should you head?\\n\\nUnofficially regarded as Singapore's national food, Hainanese Chicken Rice is a dish of sliced tender chicken served with fragrant rice, ginger paste and a spicy chilli sauce. Adapted from the early Chinese immigrants from Hainan Island, it's the spices and sauces used, which give the dish a unique, lingering, and lip-smacking taste. Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown is home to a Michelin Bib Gourmand recipient for its Hainanese Chicken Rice - the Tian Tian hawker stall. They serve their main dish with a side of vegetables in oyster sauce. Superb!\\n\\nTian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. Photo / Mike Yardley\\n\\nChar Kway Teow, which translates to 'fried flat rice noodles', is one of the most celebrated street foods in Singapore. It is a noodle dish made with variations of shrimps, eggs, Chinese sausage, pork lard, cockles, bean sprouts, and chives - all fried and dipped in soy sauce. The heart of this dish is lard which makes it super delicious. It is often served on a banana leaf to enhance the fragrance with a wedge of lime squeezed on the top. The Hong Lim Complex in Outram Park is one of the best places to sample this dish, because the Char Kway Teow hawker stall also proudly sports a Michelin Bib Gourmand. Queues can be formidable, but it's worth the wait.\\n\\nNative to the local cuisine, Singaporean Chilli Crab is a stir-fried crustacean dish prepared with sweet and spicy tomato sauces, mostly served with deep-fried steam buns called Mantou. Part of the primal joy of tucking into a heaping platter of chilli crab is just how messy it is to eat. Some vendors even provide plastic gloves for an easier cleanup. This Singapore staple is a must-try for seafood enthusiasts.\\n\\nA must-try traditional Peranakan dish, also synonymous with Malaysia, is Laksa - a sweet and spicy soup of rice vermicelli noodles, cooked in a creamy sauce made from coconut milk and curry-based broth. Its spice comes from other ingredients including turmeric, coriander, and galangal. It is usually served with bean curd puff, cockles, fish cakes, or bean sprouts. When it comes to global comfort foods, a lusciously creamy bowl of noodles has to rank right near the top.\\n\\nSambal Stingray is another street food classic. Sambal is a special sauce made from chilli peppers, shrimp, fish sauce, shallot, sugar, vinegar and ginger. Combined with the soft, delicate and distinctive stingray meat, the palate is exquisite. This dish tastes best barbequed, wrapped in banana leaves. Malay culture conceived this popular street food of Singapore after discovering what a winning pairing that Sambal on top of Stingray is.\\n\\nLiterally meaning 'Meat bone tea', Bak Kut Teh is like a cherished all-day breakfast in Singapore. This local dish is a pork rib soup, in a broth of herbs and spices. Comprising of pork, offal, mushroom, choy sum, tofu and puffs, the soup is spiced up with cinnamon, cloves, garlic, fennel and star anise. This dish is relished with tea in the belief that tea will help saturate a large amount of fat in the soup. I've just tried Bak Hut Teh for the first time and I'm sold! The peppery, pork rib broth simmers for hours, developing a profound depth of flavour in the process and the meat is so tender. The dish has its roots in Singapore's Teochew community, a group that immigrated from southern China. Ng Ah Sio Pork Ribs Soup Eating House, just off Clarke Quay, has been a Singapore go-to for half a century.\\n\\nA cheap and cheerful breakfast staple is Kaya Toast. The toast is coated in this lusciously sweet jam, made with coconut, sugar, and eggs. The mixture is cooked down until thick, rich, and lightly caramelised. Pandan leaves are what give this spread both its fragrance and distinctive green colour. To the uninitiated, pandan smells vaguely reminiscent of vanilla mixed with pine.\\n\\nSnacks and pick me ups? Curry puffs are a marvel. Similar to a small pie or samosa, the flaky puff pastry is typically filled with chicken, curry, potato and egg. Fillings vary from vendor to vendor, so graze widely. When you're feasting at Maxwell, don't miss the Fuzhou Oyster Cake stall. Established 60 years ago by Madam Pang, the family-run business specialises in these tasty morsels, which Michelin raves about.\\n\\nTanglin Crispy Curry Puff. Photo / Mike Yardley\\n\\nI'm also a devotee of Roti Tisu, or tissue bread. Made from the same dough used in Roti flatbread, it is then stretched to a translucent, paper-thin thickness, before being placed on the pan to fry with condensed milk. Head to any coffee shop in Little India and whistle up a sweet Roti Tisu. Served on a plate like a giant conical hat, it's a statement snack.\\n\\nShaped like a UFO, the Fuzhou Oyster Cake consists of a rice-based fried batter encasing moist minced meat, chopped oysters, crunchy peanuts, and coriander. Fried in small batches to ensure freshness, resulting in both chewy and crispy textures. Spectacular! If you're familiar with Hawai'i's famed Dole Whip, pineapple lovers rejoice! I must give a shout-out to McDonalds Singapore who pump out Pineapple Soft Serve in a cone for just $1.20. It's nearly as good as the Hawaiian classic, and a trusty rejuvenator when that sultry Singapore heat starts to get the better of you!\\n\\nMaxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cakes.

The pass features a starring array of indelible city experiences, but the food tours on foot are particularly good. There's even a food tour which is focused on Michelin recommended hawker stalls.

All of my flights ran to time, all checked bags were faithfully waiting for me on the carousel and the in-flight experience was impeccable. The illustrious full-service carrier has not only fostered a world-beating reputation for its exceptional customer service and in-flight product, but also its innovation, across all classes. You'd struggle to find a better Economy class experience in the skies, but if you're wondering if Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines is worth upgrading to, you're absolutely in for a treat.\\n\\nI experienced the cabin on their A350-900 aircraft, which is a daily fixture on their Auckland and Christchurch services to Singapore. Premium Economy is an increasingly enticing option for Kiwis flying long-haul and hankering for affordable space and extra-comfort.\\n\\nA350 Premium Economy. Photo / Supplied\\n\\nI enjoyed priority handling and boarding, before kicking back in my comfy cabin, where the seating is arranged in a 2-4-2 seating arrangement - ideal if you're travelling as a couple. The enhanced sense of spaciousness is readily apparent with greater seat width of 49.5 centimetres including a calf-rest and footrest, 96cms seat pitch and 20cms of sweet sleep-inducing recline. It's striking how just a little bit more space and recline can make a world of difference.\\n\\nCharles de Cazanove Brut Champagne freely flowed throughout the cabin, as did the Singapore Slings. Don't mind if I do! The in-flight dining service features an exquisite menu that includes dishes created by the Airline's International Culinary Panel, with gourmet dining for Premium Economy guests, including the extensive pre-flight Book the Cook menu. I noshed on a fabulous Chicken Breast with mushroom cream sauce, while the Fruit Crumble with Anglaise sauce was a delightful dessert.\\n\\nYou'll enjoy individual in-seat power supply, two USB ports, personal in-seat reading light, cocktail table, and additional stowage space for personal items. The KrisWorld entertainment system brims with over 1000 movie, TV, music and gaming selections, plus live news and sport. Equipped with noise cancelling headphones, the high-definition touch screen monitors are supersized at 33cms, from which I devoured so much content. The in-flight WiFi worked a trick too - complimentary for KrisFlyer members.

They played an integral role in bringing life to Mitchell\\'s Creative Way, a new art alley between Main Street and Lawler Street that officially opened Friday, Sept. 27, 2024. It\\'s located just west of Wells Fargo bank and is modeled after an\\n\\nart alley in Rapid City that has been around for more than 20 years.\\n\\n\"If we can find a good spot, let\\'s do it,\" said Schwalm, explaining that Sherwood brought the idea to the Mitchell Area Council of the Arts when he joined the five-person board.\\n\\nAnd they did, thanks in large part to Sherwood -- whom Schwalm called \"the catalyst of the whole project.\"\\n\\nHe already has quite an impact on Mitchell\\'s downtown through window art and murals on Main Street businesses, including a large painting on the side of Main Street Mercantile.\\n\\nIt was more than 10 years ago when he painted in Rapid City\\'s art alley, a piece that highlighted his son Logan\\'s name and birthday. When his son turned 6, Stan and Logan returned to let Logan make his impression painting at the Rapid City art alley.\\n\\nNow that idea and opportunity has come to Mitchell.\\n\\nSherwood said the hope is for young artists who don\\'t know how to get seen publicly, or perhaps shy, to utilize the wall.\\n\\n\"They can come down here any time of the day, once they get a permit, and just do it,\" Sherwood said Friday. \"They don\\'t have to take credit, but inside they\\'ll know they did it.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note artists must obtain a free permit to paint, but it\\'s a minor hurdle to ensure whatever is created will be business-friendly, Schwalm said. To get a permit, anyone needs to check in with the Mitchell Area Council of the Arts, either by talking to one of the board members or by\\n\\napplying online at the organization\\'s website.\\n\\nSherwood said two permits were filled out before the alleyway was even officially opened, and other artists have inquired about doing the same.\\n\\nThe flat, white wall on the east side of the alley is a low, accessible spot for painting. To the west is another building that is available for use, OK\\'d by owner John Adamo, a California real estate developer who owns six Main Street buildings.\\n\\nThe hope is to continue the art alley further north and south as building owners see progress. That in turn could encourage visitors to trek from the Corn Palace south to check out the art and likely, Main Street businesses.\\n\\nSherwood said anyone ages 5 to 95 can paint as a way to express themselves.

These tariffs would mirror those imposed by other countries on American imports, a move Trump believes will level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers.\\n\\nHe described tariffs as a \"beautiful word,\" suggesting they would be a key tool in his administration\\'s efforts to revitalize American industry.\\n\\nThe former president didn\\'t mince words when discussing the potential impact of his policies on foreign-made vehicles.\\n\\nTrump proposed a staggering 200% tariff on cars imported from Mexico, asserting that such a measure would make these vehicles \"unsellable\" in the U.S. market. This bold stance underscores his commitment to prioritizing American-made products and protecting domestic jobs.\\n\\nIn a surprising announcement, Trump revealed that Elon Musk, the innovative entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, would serve as the administration\\'s \"cost cutter\" if he wins the November election. This decision signals Trump\\'s intention to bring fresh, business-oriented thinking to government operations, potentially streamlining processes and reducing wasteful spending.\\n\\nTrump\\'s choice of Musk for this role is particularly noteworthy given the tech titan\\'s track record of disrupting traditional industries and driving innovation. Musk\\'s experience in revolutionizing the automotive and space industries could prove invaluable in Trump\\'s efforts to modernize and streamline government operations.\\n\\nThe former president also took aim at his political opponents, criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris\\'s policies on her agenda around electric vehicles.\\n\\nTrump argued that Harris\\'s push for electric cars would primarily benefit manufacturers in China and Mexico, rather than American workers. He positioned his own policies as a direct counter to this approach, promising to prioritize American jobs and manufacturing.\\n\\nTrump\\'s message resonated strongly with the Michigan crowd, many of whom have witnessed firsthand the decline of the state\\'s once-dominant automotive industry. His promises to revitalize manufacturing and bring jobs back to the United States struck a chord with supporters who view economic prosperity as a top priority.\\n\\nAs the election draws nearer, Trump\\'s economic vision, coupled with the potential inclusion of high-profile figures like Elon Musk in his administration, is likely to be a central theme of his campaign. The former president\\'s focus on job creation, tariffs, and American manufacturing presents a clear contrast to his opponents\\' policies, offering voters a distinct choice in November.\\n\\nWith Michigan\\'s status as a key battleground state, Trump\\'s message of economic renewal and job creation could prove crucial in swaying voters. As he told the enthusiastic crowd, \"We win Michigan, we win the whole thing... like we did in 2016.\"', 'image': 'https://resistthemainstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Untitled-design-29.png', 'sentiment': 0.4274509803921569, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340397943', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:00:34Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:00:02Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nrl/article-13900685/Latrell-Mitchell-white-powder-photo-Braydon-Trindall-mother-assault-pub-Dubbo.html', 'title': 'Mother of NRL star in white powder scandal allegedly assaulted', 'body': \"The mother of Cronulla Sharks superstar Braydon Trindall has allegedly been assaulted months after denying accusations of leaking the white powder images of Latrell Mitchell.\\n\\nMitchell was suspended for one game and fined $20,000 after a photo emerged showing him leaning over a white substance in a hotel room after a trip to Dubbo while injured.\\n\\nIn addition to the NRL's penalty, the South Sydney Rabbitohs imposed their own fine of $100,000, with $80,000 suspended unless there is another breach of his contract or wellbeing program.\\n\\nDaily Mail Australia is not suggesting the powder contained any illicit substances.\\n\\nTrindall's mother, Kerri Cochrane, was dragged into the scandal when she was accused of leaking the photo of Latrell Mitchell.\\n\\nShe strongly denied the accusations, stating that a fake Snapchat profile had been created using her name to distribute the image.\\n\\nAmy Brown, who appeared in the photo with Mitchell, admitted to having a 'bit of fun' but denied leaking the image.

Never seen anything close, honestly.\"\\n\\nThe Build Dakota Scholarship program is a statewide initiative created to increase the number of skilled workers entering into high-need sectors of the South Dakota workforce through the state\\'s four technical colleges in Mitchell, Rapid City, Watertown and Sioux Falls.\\n\\nStudents of any age are eligible to apply for the scholarship, which supports tuition, books and other required program materials and expenses for eligible technical college programs. Recipients in the scholarship must commit to working in South Dakota, in their field of study, for three years following graduation.\\n\\nThe scholarship is a benefit for students, who receive on-the-job training, a full-ride scholarship and the security of guaranteed employment after graduation. Among the employer benefits are a cost-effective training pipeline and opportunities to connect with potential employees.\\n\\nKnown to audiences for his hosting role on \"Dirty Jobs\" and a baritone voice that has narrated television programs and documentaries, Rowe also knows a few things about the skilled trades. He grew up spending time with and admiring his grandfather, who worked as an electrician, among other jobs, and his time on \"Dirty Jobs,\" where he performed tasks in difficult and unusual careers, further opened his eyes to the importance of skilled trade work.\\n\\nto launch a national advocacy campaign for skilled labor. His foundation also provides scholarship opportunities to the tune of about $3 million a year for students who want to learn a skill that is in demand.\\n\\nThe Build Dakota Scholarship program is a kindred spirit, and one Rowe firmly believes in. Over the past decade, the program has awarded nearly 4,000 scholarships, working alongside over 500 industry partners providing more than $21 million in matching scholarships.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s slowly helping shift outdated perceptions that trade schools are somehow lesser outposts for lesser educational opportunities, he said.\\n\\n\"They\\'re starting to get the message, and the message is there\\'s nothing wrong with a four-year degree, but the best path for the most people can\\'t be the most expensive path. It just can\\'t. And for decades, that\\'s kind of what we\\'ve been suggesting to kids,\" Rowe said. \"Today we have $1.7 trillion in student loans on the books and eight million jobs, most of which don\\'t require a four-year degree. So you\\'re loaning money we don\\'t have to kids who are never going to be able to pay it back for jobs that aren\\'t really in demand. Is that starting to change? Yeah, it is. Is it going to take even longer? For sure.\"\\n\\nRowe praised state and local leadership for making the program a reality. State-level leaders like former Gov. Dennis Daugaard worked with the state legislature to match an initial $25 million investment in the idea from T. Denny Sanford to kick off the program.\\n\\nIndustry partners and local-level leaders, like Dick Muth, a Mitchell Tech grad and booster who founded Muth Electric, which has sponsored many Build Dakota scholars, and a member of the South Dakota Hall of Fame, have lent crucial support. Rowe said the program wouldn\\'t exist without their forward thinking.\\n\\nHe said he sees the benefits of the scholarship program personified in the students climbing electrical poles at Mitchell Tech\\'s powerline classes and their work in other programs. He even met a few individuals on the tour who had received scholarships from his own foundation.\\n\\n\"On a personal level, meeting guys who are climbing poles, who applied for a scholarship from my foundation and got one, running into them here, is very gratifying. So whether it\\'s Build Dakota, whether it\\'s mikeroweWORKS, there are plenty of places for a curious kid to get the money they need to embark on this thing.\"\\n\\nClayton Deuter, vice president of enrollment services for Mitchell Tech, said the day\\'s activities were a celebration of the students and the scholarship, but having Rowe on hand to help mark the occasion was special. Deuter accompanied Rowe on the campus tour and noted his down-to-darth persona was a good match for students and staff.\\n\\nRowe understands the workforce situation and need, he said, and having a well-known television personality boosting for the scholarship and school is a definite plus.\\n\\n\"I think the biggest thing is it brings the spotlight to the Build Dakota Scholarship program and its 10 year anniversary, but it also brings a bigger spotlight to the high-need areas in the state,\" Deuter said. \"And those are in the trade and technical areas, whether it\\'s nursing, radiology or heating and cooling. There\\'s a wide variety of high-need programs, meaning that the industry needs the students desperately when they graduate. They just don\\'t have enough people going out into the workforce.\"\\n\\nMitchell Tech is getting more and more of those professionals into a workforce hungry for them. About 99% of school graduates are employed or continuing their education within six months of graduation, according to the school website.\\n\\nIn the last 10 years, Mitchell Technical College has gone from offering around 55 Build Dakota Scholarships in the beginning to 155 scholarships this year, thanks in large part to the increase in industry partners working with the program, Deuter said. There are currently about 156 industry partners associated with the program, and Mitchell Tech has hosted 851 Build Dakota scholars on campus since the program\\'s inception.\\n\\nThe benefits to students are myriad, Deuter said, and Mitchell Tech benefits itself from having good students on campus. All that jibes with the work Rowe is doing to sway opinions about technical colleges in general, he said.\\n\\n\"A lot of that is because of the Build Dakota Scholarship helping change that perception of technical colleges out there,\" Deuter said.\\n\\nRowe\\'s visit Thursday concluded with a chat-style panel that also included Deuter, Muth, Mike Sprang, who serves as chair of the Mitchell Technical College Foundation board of trustees, and Dana Dykhouse, chair of the Build Dakota Scholarship board and CEO of First Premier Bank.\\n\\nIn a statement, Dykhouse both praised Rowe and reflected on the success of the scholarship program as well as the public and private sector cooperation at its heart.\\n\\n\"There\\'s not a bigger name in technical education than Mike Rowe, and having him in South Dakota to help celebrate the success of the Build Dakota Scholarship program is a testament to the outstanding efforts of so many,\" Dykhouse said. \"I\\'m proud of the impact this program has had on the workforce issues facing our state and we should all be proud of the public-private partnership that made all of this a reality.\"\\n\\nThough not a part of the panel, Daugaard was also in attendance as a member of the audience. He praised individuals like Dykhouse for their leadership in the effort, along with the industry partners who have stepped in to work with students who are anxious to jump headlong into their new career.\\n\\nJudging by the ongoing support, he said he saw no reason the program wouldn\\'t be serving students and the workforce for years to come.\\n\\n\"I\\'m just very excited after 10 years to see what the Build Dakota program has become. I had no way of foreseeing the way industry has responded,\" Daugaard told the Mitchell Republic. \"And now here we are, and the program has an endowment of over $40 million. So that will be providing scholarships in perpetuity.\"\\n\\nThe visit to Mitchell Tech Thursday followed stops at Lake Area Technical College in Watertown and Southeast Technical College in Sioux Falls where he also took tours and spoke with students and faculty. When his time in Mitchell wrapped up, he was scheduled to head west to Western Dakota Technical College in Rapid City.\\n\\nIt made for a long but fulfilling day for Rowe, who said he would continue to support efforts like the one he saw on display in Mitchell and across South Dakota. The Build Dakota program, the state trade schools, and their industry partners are a prime example of how to make an impact on the challenge of filling high-need jobs across the country, he said.\\n\\nBoth four-year colleges and trade schools play important roles in America\\'s educational landscape, he just wants to make sure those interested in skilled trades know that they are valued, they are wanted and there are programs out there to help them achieve their goals.\\n\\nProgress is being made, but there is more work to do, he said.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to make the mistake of minimizing higher ed in my attempts to elevate the skilled trade of the working classes. They\\'re two sides of the same coin, and if our workforce isn\\'t balanced and equally respective of all of it, we\\'re collectively screwed,\" Rowe said. \"Because the garbage isn\\'t going to clean itself up and the planes aren\\'t going to fly themselves. That\\'s never going to change, and that\\'s why we\\'re here.\"\\n\\nMore information about the Build Dakota Scholarship program can be found at www.builddakotascholarships.com.', 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png', 'sentiment': 0.1137254901960785, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340398138', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:00:38Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:00:18Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/2024/09/27/pop-colab-puts-playtime-into-workday', 'title': 'Pop CoLab puts playtime into workday', 'body': 'I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies, and CASL agreement.\\n\\nAttending mocktail parties during the workday is always an option at a new downtown Winnipeg venture.\\n\\nTucked underneath the Richardson Centre, behind a retail storefront selling Manitoba-made goods, there\\'s a space where businesses can book play time.\\n\\nOne corner holds the mocktail making bar, ready with cans of sparkling water.

He acquired, expanded and sold A Little Pizza Heaven. For years, he headed Vantage Studios, a marketing firm inside the Richardson Centre.\\n\\nCabato, who used to work for Vantage, took ownership of Made Here, a shop steps away from Pop CoLab. (The couple run Made Here and Pop CoLab together.)\\n\\nPop CoLab\\'s retail section came first, opening in February. A kiosk is devoted to Sobr Market\\'s goods; Robinson regularly pulls the non-alcoholic beverages to the back for group sessions.\\n\\nAnd the sessions are still being developed, Robinson explained. Groups usually come a couple times a week, though inquiries are increasing.\\n\\nBusinesses book hour-long slots -- sometimes full days -- to get creative with staff. Sessions happen during the daytime and in the evening.\\n\\n\"It kind of lets people\\'s guard down when they\\'re doing something,\" he said. \"It\\'s not about making a button -- it\\'s about the process and just having fun.\"\\n\\nHe and Cabato watch co-workers who barely know each other connect. One social media company with a remote set-up spent the day in Pop CoLab, breaking up work with CoLab programming.\\n\\nThe duo has noticed more workers walking through the underground concourse.\\n\\n\"Companies are trying to get their people to come back, but what\\'s there?\" Robinson said. \"The buildings want amenities.\\n\\n\"We kind of have to take that leap and say, \\'OK, we\\'re going to position ourselves here in hopes that everything kind of falls into place.\\'\"\\n\\nBuilding owners have spent millions of dollars on renovations as a \"carrot\" for returning downtown workers, noted Tom Thiessen, executive director of the Building Owners and Managers Association\\'s Manitoba chapter.\\n\\nBike storage and change facilities, golf simulators, upgraded gyms and social spaces -- it all resulted from a COVID-19 pandemic-era flight from the office.\\n\\n\"We\\'re actually seeing a lot of pretty serious overhauls,\" Thiessen said. \"The physical layout of some of these spaces is ... pretty remarkable from what you\\'d expect of a typical office layout 10 or 15 years ago.\"\\n\\nThe $25-million facelift done at 201 Portage is on the high end of renovation costs, Thiessen added.\\n\\nHybrid continues to be the most popular set-up, according to both he and Loren Remillard, president of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce.\\n\\nRemillard called it \"not surprising\" to see Pop CoLab as a tenant of the Richardson concourse.\\n\\n\"Every property owner ... is taking a look and trying to make sure that they\\'re presenting the best package ... possible,\" Remillard said.\\n\\nPop CoLab can fit 20 to 25 people inside comfortably. It\\'s looking to grow its range of workshops by partnering with local businesses. Already, staff from a nearby plant shop trek to Pop to host wreath and terrarium making sessions.\\n\\nPop CoLab -- the \"lab\" is short for laboratory -- is also building its membership base, Robinson shared.\\n\\nCertain hours are reserved for drop-ins, where people can use creative gear. A membership costs $24.99 per month; $10 will net a single entry.\\n\\nGroup session rates vary, Robinson explained. It starts at $50 hourly per person. Programming costs extra.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s a great asset to downtown,\" Braelyn Koop, who\\'s been working for Robinson and Cabato since November, said of Pop CoLab. \"There isn\\'t ... much like it anywhere else where you can do team-building and do arts and crafts.\"\\n\\nCards she\\'s designed sell in front shop. They share space with products made by Manitoba Mรฉtis Federation artists (Robinson is Mรฉtis), and items made at North Forge\\'s fabrication lab, among others.

This is a plan of dubious constitutionality to undermine the electoral system. It would make elections less safe and even more partisan than they already are if you can imagine that.\\n\\nThe compact consists of states tying their votes in the Electoral College to the national popular vote total. It means that each state in the compact would award its electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes in the country, even if that candidate lost in that state. At present, 17 states and the District of Columbia have tied their 209 electoral votes to the national popular vote, getting closer to the 270 electoral votes needed for a candidate to become president.\\n\\nThe compact is popular only with Democrats, which makes sense because the party often wins the popular vote even when it loses the presidency. Democrats enthusiastic to tie their state\\'s Electoral College votes to the popular vote assume this will help Democrats, as indeed it would in current circumstances. But it is utterly devoid of principle.\\n\\nThere is a useful thought experiment one can force upon Democrats when they tout the \"democratic\" principle of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. All you need to do is ask them this: \"So let\\'s say your state voted for Kamala Harris, but Donald Trump won the popular vote, you\\'d be content that your state\\'s Electoral College votes would be cast for Trump, right?\" This usually produces a certain amount of stuttering and foot shuffling and the circumstantial but unprincipled retort, \"But that\\'s not likely to happen.\"\\n\\nThe compact fundamentally contradicts what America is supposed to be. We are the \"United States,\" or are supposed to be, which implies including all those participating in the federal system, not excluding those with whom one disagrees.\\n\\nThe states make up the country. The nation does not have the right to treat smaller states as subservient departments.\\n\\nThe loss of this concept of genuine federalism is why the federal government has become more intrusive in everyday life, as voters and the parties, especially the Democratic Party, expect the president to absorb responsibilities that should fall to state governments.\\n\\nThe national popular vote idea is thus a \"solution\" to a problem that doesn\\'t exist. The system works as it is because it forces presidential candidates to make appeals to broad swaths of the country. Trump lost the popular vote but won 30 of the 50 states in 2016. A candidate needs to convince voters in Arizona, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Georgia, states with unique cultures and issues, that he or she should be president.\\n\\nA system that simply awarded the presidency to the winner of the most votes nationwide would produce campaigns intent solely on riling up their party base. If the country is divided now, as it is, imagine a national popular vote election that frees Democrats and Republicans alike from the tempering effect of \"swing states\" and instead encourages them to juice up antagonisms to drive their flock to polling places.\\n\\nThus far, only Democratic-controlled states and Washington, D.C., have signed on to the compact. This stems from Democratic chagrin about the 2000 election that Al Gore lost. They believe dearly that he should have been the winner because he \"won the popular vote\" against George W. Bush. The 2016 election revived that sentiment after Clinton \"won the popular vote\" but not the presidency.\\n\\nThe 2016 election is a perfect representation of how Democrats view the electoral system. Clinton\\'s campaign ran up vote totals in big liberal cities. Her win by 2.9 million in the popular vote is due solely to her ability to rack up a landslide in California. She secured a margin of 1.7 million in Los Angeles County alone. Clinton was very popular in small pockets of the country where Democratic voters congregate, so both she and the Democratic Party think she shouldn\\'t have to waste their time trying to win voters in the middle of the country. She didn\\'t visit the swing state of Wisconsin once after the Democratic National Convention. She and the blue party regarded the heartland as literally flyover country. Basing the presidential election result on the national popular vote tally would make that permanent.\\n\\nDemocrats seem to think that because their popular vote margin doesn\\'t mean anything in the current electoral system, that system must change. In truth, it is the Democrats who must change. They must change to try to win votes in flyover country. It is the same logic behind the Democratic push for statehood for Washington, D.C., which would gift the Democratic Party two senators. Democrats don\\'t want to have to campaign in states in the middle of the country to get power on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nIt should be noted that the compact contains a trigger, and states don\\'t have to pull that trigger until enough states join to reach 270 electoral votes. It\\'s just another wrinkle Democrats added to ensure they don\\'t accidentally award a Republican presidential candidate the White House in a scenario in which the GOP wins the \"popular vote\" but Democrats win the Electoral College, a possibility this November.\\n\\nSo, the popular vote compact fails in principle with what the U.S. is meant to be and fails in concept as a \"solution\" to an imagined problem, given that it is nothing more than a Democratic power grab. Just as damning, though, is that the national popular vote would fail in practice by making elections more prone to widespread fraud and fuel rampant distrust among the general public.\\n\\nIf you thought Trump\\'s election conspiracy theories were bad in 2020, imagine how many people would reasonably believe them under a popular vote system. A national popular vote would encourage political actors in both parties to engage in all kinds of chicanery, including voter fraud and voter suppression, because the goal would simply be to have more votes total than the other team.\\n\\nWhile Trump\\'s claims of massive voter fraud are weak, there is some fraud that pops up in competitive races, such as in the 2008 Senate race in Minnesota, which secured the Democratic Party the filibuster-proof Senate majority that gave us Obamacare. The incentive to cheat in a presidential election decided only by raw vote totals rather than electoral votes would lead to far more fraud on a much larger scale.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t just a hypothetical, given that Democrats in Colorado, Maine, and Illinois all tried to remove Trump from their ballots. That would all but guarantee a Democratic win in the \"popular vote,\" resulting in a tit-for-tat in which each state ends up with one presidential candidate on the ballot depending on what party runs the state.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\\n\\nPicture the 2016 election, with Trump leading by some 2 million votes the day after the election, only for California\\'s glacial vote count to chip away at that lead for more than a month. It wouldn\\'t be until December that all the votes would be counted in California, giving far more credence to accusations that Democrats would \"find\" votes to make up the total they needed.\\n\\nThe national popular vote compact is lazy, destructive, ill-thought-out, blatantly partisan, and a defiance of the principles that make up America\\'s federal system. It is thus the perfect Democratic policy. As a means of choosing American presidents, it would manage to make every aspect of campaigns, governance, institutional trust, and the balance of power between states and the federal government worse. Given that both parties claim their last presidential loss only happened because the race was \"stolen\" from them, this supposed \"solution\" couldn\\'t come at a worse time.', 'image': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hillary-clinton-kamala-harris-2024.webp', 'sentiment': -0.01960784313725494, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340396427', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:00:52Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T23:57:25Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/09/28/former-pkr-reps-fail-in-appeal-bid-over-seats', 'title': 'Former PKR reps fail in appeal bid over seats', 'body': 'PUTRAJAYA: Two former Penang assemblymen failed yet again to challenge a motion passed by the state assembly that compelled them to vacate their seats.\\n\\nIn a unanimous decision yesterday, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals by former Sungai Acheh assemblyman Zulkifli Ibrahim and former Seberang Jaya assemblyman Dr Afif Bahardin.\\n\\nThe judgment was delivered by a three-judge panel.\\n\\n\"We find no error in the reasoning made by the High Court and we fully endorse the reasons of the High Court,\" said Justice Che Mohd Ruzima Ghazali, Bernama reported.\\n\\nZulkifli and Dr Afif were appealing against the Penang High Court\\'s decision on Dec 8 last year, which upheld the motion passed by the state legislative assembly declaring their seats vacant.\\n\\nHigh Court judge Justice Anand Ponnudurai had ruled that Zulkifli and Dr Afif were rightly disqualified from the state legislative assembly following their expulsion from PKR, in accordance with Article 14A of the Penang state constitution, which prohibits party hopping.\\n\\nAfter their expulsion from PKR, Zulkifli and Dr Afif joined Bersatu, prompting the motion for them to vacate their seats.', 'image': 'https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/09/28/2936485.jpg', 'sentiment': 0.05098039215686279, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340398271', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:00:54Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:00:30Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.501960813999176, 'url': 'https://www.ntd.com/remote-control-of-cars-could-cause-problems-expert_1019850.html', 'title': 'Remote Control of Cars Could Cause Problems: Expert', 'body': 'Washington is doubling down on rooting out a Chinese threat.

For example, Australia has launched its Digital Economy Strategy 2022 Update, aiming to advance the country's digital economy by 2030.\\n\\nRise in Mergers and Acquisitions & Joint Ventures\\n\\nThe APAC data center market's significant growth potential drives operators to invest in mergers and acquisitions and form joint ventures for new projects. Global organizations are increasingly entering the market through these partnerships. A notable example is STACK Infrastructure, which entered the South Korean market through a joint venture with ESR Cayman to develop a data center.\\n\\nThe China Data Center Colocation Market Revenue to Reach 28.70 Billion by 2029\\n\\nAs the world's largest data center market, China is poised for significant growth with numerous upcoming infrastructure projects. Many of these initiatives will involve retrofitting existing buildings, optimizing land use, and enhancing efficiency.\\n\\nIn 2023, China introduced its first commercial subsea data center in Lingshui Li Autonomous County, Hainan Province. This innovative underwater facility features a cylindrical design, measuring 3.6 meters in diameter and weighing 1,300 tonnes -- equivalent to about 1,000 cars. The concept aligns with Hainan's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), which aims to bolster the marine economy by establishing 100 data cabins to drive technological innovation, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.\\n\\nChina remains a cost-effective location for data center development, with construction costs in Shanghai ranging from $7 to $8 per watt in 2023. Additionally, land prices in Beijing were approximately $340 per square foot, lower than other APAC cities like Tokyo, Seoul, and Jakarta.\\n\\nIn Southwest China, Guizhou Province is actively developing multiple data center projects, with an aggregate investment of $2.9 billion in 2023. Recent regulations mandate that 70% of urban buildings achieve green certification by 2022, pushing for low-carbon construction and increased use of renewable energy sources.\\n\\nKey industrial tech parks and Free Trade Zones, such as the Shanghai Free Trade Zone and Pilot Free Trade Zone in Shandong, along with various industrial tech zones in Guangdong, Liaoning, Fujian, and Zhejiang, further enhance China's data center ecosystem.\\n\\nBook the Free Sample Now: https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/apac-data-center-colocation-market-report-2024\\n\\nThe Report Includes the Investment in the Following Areas:\\n\\nThe Arizton Advisory & Intelligence market research report provides valuable market insights for industry stakeholders, investors, researchers, consultants, and business strategists aiming to thoroughly understand the APAC data center colocation market.

(NASDAQ:EQ), a biotechnology firm specializing in pharmaceutical preparations, has reported a recent transaction involving its Chief Financial Officer, Jason A. Keyes. According to a new filing, Keyes sold 10,000 shares of company stock, resulting in total proceeds of $8,100.\\n\\nThe transaction, which took place on September 26, 2024, was executed under a 10b5-1 trading plan previously adopted by Keyes on March 27, 2024. This type of trading plan allows company insiders to sell shares over a predetermined period of time, providing a defense against potential claims of insider trading.\\n\\nThe shares were sold at a weighted average price of $0.81. However, the sales were not made at a single price point; they occurred in multiple transactions with prices ranging from $0.79 to $0.82. Should any parties require further details on the exact number of shares sold at each price within this range, Keyes has agreed to furnish full information upon request.\\n\\nFollowing the sale, Keyes still retains a substantial interest in Equillium, Inc., with 57,720 shares held indirectly through The Keyes Trust, dated September 10, 2004. Additionally, Keyes directly owns 73,913 shares of the company's common stock.\\n\\nInvestors and interested parties often monitor insider transactions as they can provide insights into the executives' perspectives on the company's current valuation and future prospects.\\n\\nIn other recent news, Equillium Inc . announced its Phase 3 EQUATOR study of itolizumab, a drug candidate for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), will proceed without modifications following a favorable recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. This development is significant given the high mortality rates associated with aGVHD and the limited effectiveness of current treatments. In another development, Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has a 90-day period to decide on acquiring Equillium's rights to itolizumab for approximately $35 million, with potential additional milestone payments that could total $101.4 million.\\n\\nEquillium also disclosed an estimated $33.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a recent regulatory filing. The company reported positive results from its Phase 2 study of EQ101, a novel therapy for alopecia areata, and a Phase 1b EQUALISE trial on itolizumab, a new treatment for lupus nephritis.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Nasdaq has notified Equillium that it is currently not in compliance with the exchange's minimum bid price requirement. The company has been granted a 180-day grace period to address the issue and regain compliance. These are recent developments in Equillium's larger initiative to tackle autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.\\n\\nTo provide additional context to Jason A. Keyes' recent stock sale, let's examine some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro for Equillium, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQ).\\n\\nAs of the latest data, Equillium's market capitalization stands at $29.47 million, reflecting its current valuation in the biotechnology sector. The company has demonstrated strong revenue growth, with a 51.83% increase in quarterly revenue as of Q2 2024. This growth trajectory aligns with the company's focus on pharmaceutical preparations and could be a factor in executive decision-making regarding stock transactions.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that Equillium is currently operating at a loss, with an adjusted operating income of -$9.71 million over the last twelve months. This is reflected in one of the InvestingPro Tips, which indicates that analysts do not anticipate the company to be profitable this year. This financial situation might provide context for why insiders like Keyes might choose to sell some of their holdings.\\n\\nAnother relevant InvestingPro Tip highlights that Equillium's stock price movements are quite volatile. This volatility is evident in the company's recent price performance, with a strong 24.58% return over the last three months, contrasted by a significant -59.6% decline over the past six months. Such fluctuations could influence insider trading decisions and timing.\\n\\nFor investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights. In fact, there are 10 more InvestingPro Tips available for Equillium, which could provide valuable perspective on the company's financial health and market position.\", 'image': 'https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/World_News_9_800x533_L_1420026261.jpg', 'sentiment': 0.3647058823529412, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340398257', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:01:02Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:00:27Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://dailynews.co.zw/3ktv-broadcasts-aau-local-launch/', 'title': '3Ktv broadcasts AAU local launch', 'body': 'THERE was much pomp and ceremony as the Association of African Universities (AAU) launched its regional offices at the Women\\'s University in Africa (WUA) campus in Harare yesterday.\\n\\nIndependent national television station, 3Ktv, successfully beamed live the lively and momentous event, as the two-and-a-half-year-old channel continues to grow from strength to strength.\\n\\nSpeaking at the launch ceremony, WUA vice chancellor Sunungurai Chingarande urged all Sadc universities to utilise the new regional office to develop higher education in Southern Africa.\\n\\n\"This will be the voice of higher education in the region. \"We are inviting all relevant parties to join us and work together to ensure development and integration of our region through higher education. \"We also appreciate the Government of Zimbabwe\\'s support for this initiative,\" Chingarande added.\\n\\nThe deputy minister of Higher Education, Simelisizwe Sibanda -- who stood in for minister Amon Murwira -- said the opening of the AAU\\'s regional offices in Zimbabwe was a sign of its confidence in local tertiary institutions.\\n\\n\"Today is not only an important day for the Women\\'s University in Africa and its founders, but a pride for the whole country and the Southern African region as we witness the launch of the AAU regional office here at WUA.\\n\\n\"As the government, we are grateful for the partnership between WUA and AAU, which is enabling WUA to be the host of the AAU Southern Africa Regional Office.

This audio drama stars a number of local voice actors and volunteers.\\n\\nDouglas sat down with state historian Stan Bumgardner to discuss the event and the atmosphere in Mingo County at the time.\\n\\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nDouglas: Let\\'s talk about the atmosphere in West Virginia in 1914.\\n\\nBumgardner: 1914 is in some ways, a pivotal year in West Virginia. There\\'s no way to quantify this, but certainly one of the deadliest coal mine strikes, or strikes period, in U.S. history was at Paint Creek and Cabin Creek in Kanawha County. At the time of the Glen Alum robbery, prohibition had just come into effect in West Virginia, which happened nearly six years before it happened nationally.\\n\\nBut what was happening in southern West Virginia was just massive change. And I mean, everything was changing. Before the Civil War, and even after the Civil War, you know, this had been a sparsely populated area, just some scattered farmland, and really not much of that because of the terrain. If you look at the census numbers, very few people lived in Mingo County, and in certain parts of McDowell County, very few people lived there until the railroads came. The railroad started coming in the 1880s and then by the 1890s, the Norfolk and Western had reached what\\'s now Mingo County. At that time it was part of Logan County. Mingo County is our newest county. It came in in 1895 and it\\'s almost solely due to the arrival of the N&W, the Norfolk and Western, and the opening of coal mines. Towns were being built, seemingly overnight, they were all over the place in that part of the state, and places where almost nobody had lived.\\n\\nDouglas: I\\'ve always wondered about that. I knew Mingo split off from Logan, but I always wondered why, and so it was just growing so fast that somebody decided, no, we need a separate local government.\\n\\nBumgardner: The area that\\'s now Mingo County was kind of an isolated part of Logan County before the N&W arrived. However, when the N&W arrived,there was such an influx of people.The old rule was that you were supposed to be able to get to the county seat and back in a day. That\\'s how they determined county borders. And that\\'s why today, it seems ridiculous sometimes that we have counties with county seats that you can drive to, they\\'re 20 minutes apart, right? But back then you might need a whole day or more. The influx of population into Mingo County was incredible at that time period. The other thing is that you had competing railroads, competing coal companies. The Norfolk and Western was a little different from other railroads that came through. They had watched what had happened with the Chesapeake and Ohio, which came in the 1870s and when that railroad came through southern West Virginia, you had a lot of what I\\'d call freelance coal operators who just came in and took advantage of the fact that there was this railroad now that they could get the coal to market. That\\'s what was holding back the coal industry, mainly in southern West Virginia, is just, how do you get it out of there?\\n\\nSo when the Chesapeake and Ohio, the C&O came through, there were examples of miners who just became rich, who figured out how to run their own operations. There were coal operators who moved into the region. By the time the N&W came around, the organizers realized, \"We\\'re missing out on half of the money.\" The railroads were making a lot of the money, but there\\'s a lot of money to be made in mining the coal. So the N&W with a decade of knowledge about what has happened with the C&O, the N&W\\'s leaders went in and bought massive amounts of coal land adjoining the railroads and adjoining the branches of the railroads. So, Mingo County was very much an N&W county. If you\\'re in control of the economy and you can control the government, then you\\'ve got the whole shebang.\\n\\nDouglas: Why was prohibition in six years before national prohibition? How did that happen?\\n\\nBumgardner: Men were getting paid on Friday, and by Saturday, the money was all gone on alcohol. And there were problems associated with alcohol and towns that cater to that. You had some now legendary drinking and red light districts and things in southern West Virginia that were being called to attention. Essentially, they had just gotten enough votes by 1914 but this was a movement that was sweeping the country. There were many states that were going dry before it happened nationally. It should be noted that there was a kind of a racist component to some in the temperance movement and they did this very publicly. They associated drinking and the problems with drinking, particularly with immigrants, and so that became a target. It was kind of an anti-immigrant movement as well as an anti-drinking movement.\\n\\nDouglas: I\\'ve often wondered, this massive influx of immigrant populations coming into work in the mines and on the railroads, was there a lot of pushback among the native born, or did they remember that they were just one or two generations removed themselves and didn\\'t worry about it a whole lot?\\n\\nBumgardner: It was an interesting situation. There was a very anti-immigrant philosophy that was happening all across the country, that the immigrants were coming in, particularly from Eastern Europe, and that they were taking jobs away from native born West Virginians and native born Americans. But there weren\\'t enough laborers to fill the jobs. West Virginia\\'s economy was really booming. That sounds like something we can\\'t relate to because of what West Virginia\\'s economic situation has been for so long. But people were pouring into West Virginia to fill jobs, and they couldn\\'t fill the job fast enough, whether it was in coal mines or factories wherever. And so there was a need for all of this labor. But this gets into some of the trying to stop the labor movement from developing is that coal mine operators would one of them, Justus Collins even referred to it as a judicious mixture, which was, \"We want the right balance of native born whites and blacks and immigrants to help balance off each other,\" and it was successful at times. They fomented this resentment toward these other groups so they wouldn\\'t pull together in union.\\n\\nDouglas: Let\\'s talk about the Black Hand for a second. So as my understanding, a lot of that was up in the northern part of the state, in the Italian community. But give me the short version of what the Black Hand was.\\n\\nBumgardner: The Black Hand is often associated with, it\\'s even used interchangeably with, the mafia, but it\\'s not. It\\'s a variation of all that. They were principally into extortion and it was extortion by Italian immigrants and Italian Americans against Italian immigrants that they would threaten, they would blackmail. There were kidnappings, or threatenings of kidnappings, of murder, and unless you paid up money, unless you paid a percentage of your business. If you were an Italian storekeeper, you were a target. If you were an Italian professional who made money, you were a target of the Black Hand.\\n\\nDouglas: I recall reading that if you were the subject of this, you would get a letter. I don\\'t know if it was in the mail or it was just stuck under your door, and there would be a drawing of a black hand on it, or a couple different other symbols.\\n\\nBumgardner: It wasn\\'t just a one time deal. Once you paid them, you kept paying to them. It was a regular racket, so you had to pay a percentage of what you brought in. It was a very scary time for Italian immigrants. And that\\'s a key point, it was such a small percentage of people, of Italians, who were doing this to other Italian immigrants that they were taking advantage of these people who had limited knowledge of the laws, of the language, of anything else. And many people felt like, well, the law enforcement is not going to protect us. Our neighbors aren\\'t going to protect us, so we have to either pay up or defend ourselves.\\n\\nDouglas: Now we\\'ve set the stage for the audio drama, \"The Last Train to Glen Alum,\" let\\'s talk about what happened.\\n\\nBumgardner: Again, it goes back to money. There were tens of thousands of dollars pouring into towns through railroad depots every day just to meet payroll. It was August 14, 1914 and the N&W train was coming into Glen Alum and Mingo County carrying its $7,000 cash payroll. Just like in old movies, they knew. The robbers knew exactly when the train was going to arrive. It always arrived at the same time. They knew how much money was going to be on, because the payroll was the same. It was very easy to plan when things are that scheduled and that regular. It makes it a lot easier to plan a robbery, especially when there\\'s not a strong law enforcement presence.\\n\\nDouglas: Sheriff Hatfield didn\\'t have a half dozen deputies standing around.\\n\\nBumgardner: I don\\'t want to make it sound like a pleasant thing, because there was a lot of corruption. But, it was kind of like on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" in Mayberry, where there\\'s one sheriff and a deputy, and they can handle minor problems that occur. But three guys get murdered and $7,000 gets stolen, a handful of law enforcement people aren\\'t going to track these people down knowing that they\\'re premeditated murderers and robbers. I mean, this wasn\\'t a crime of passion. These people had planned this and killed in cold blood, and they certainly would be willing to do it again.\\n\\nHe started with they think between 25 and 50 men, but nobody knows exactly. The mines shut down, businesses shut down, and men joined the posse. It eventually built up to hundreds of men. So Sheriff Greenway Hatfield had a small army to go after five men, but still they were looking in one of the most rural, rugged areas of West Virginia.\\n\\nAnd so it was easy to hide, but if you look long enough, you\\'re going to catch them, because the criminals didn\\'t really have a great escape plan. That\\'s been my take on it forever, is that they planned the robbery. They planned everything about it, but they didn\\'t really figure out \"How are we getting out of here efficiently?\" Maybe they thought word wouldn\\'t spread. Maybe they thought they had a few days before anyone would find out. But it clearly wasn\\'t thought out very well.\\n\\nDouglas: When the posse ultimately killed the robbers, they were Italian or appeared to be Italian, but nobody knew who they were. They laid them out in town like you see in the Old West stories. But nobody ever came to claim them. What does that say to you?\\n\\nBumgardner: Especially with immigrants in the early 20th century in West Virginia, the head of the family would come over first and establish himself, and then send for their families. And sometimes they never sent for their families. Sometimes, bad things would happen to them like, as we discussed with the Black Hand. So when you have so many new people pouring into an area, it\\'s hard to document who\\'s there.\\n\\nMingo County\\'s population doubled between 1900 and 1910. There\\'s certainly a 1910 census that shows us who was there. But then, by 1920, it increased more than 50 percent again. And so there are people who are in and out of West Virginia between the censuses that nobody knew and that and that they probably didn\\'t have family, maybe not in this country. So when crimes like this happened, or people were killed, and you see this with miners, a lot with immigrant miners, is many of them were unidentified, or there was nobody to claim the body.\\n\\nAnd that worked, also, if you\\'re a criminal. That worked to your benefit, because if nobody knows you, then they can\\'t identify you. That was happening with prohibition. Right after prohibition was enacted in West Virginia, almost the exact same time, you have an influx of criminals who are just essentially jumping from state to state, who are taking advantage of prohibition by selling bootleg liquor, and if something happens to them, you know, they don\\'t have family, they don\\'t know anybody around. They\\'ve just disappeared, or they\\'ve run off with somebody.\\n\\nAnother place you see that was the Hawks Nest tunnel disaster, not because they\\'re criminals, but you had hundreds and hundreds, some have estimated nearly 1,000 people over the years, died building the Hawks Nest tunnel. So many of them were anonymous because they had migrated to West Virginia, either from other countries or Blacks in the South. If they just disappeared, didn\\'t return home, didn\\'t send word home, the thinking was, well, maybe they just ran off, right? They went and got killed, and their identities were lost to history.', 'image': 'https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Glen-Alum-Landscape-Design.png', 'sentiment': 0.0117647058823529, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340398384', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:01:08Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:00:47Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://foreignaffairs.co.nz/2024/09/28/mil-osi-new-zealand-raising-speed-limits-will-cost-our-communities/', 'title': 'MIL-OSI New Zealand: Raising speed limits will cost our communities', 'body': 'The Government\\'s move to disregard all evidence and increase speed limits will result in serious harm.\\n\\n\"The science is conclusive and the evidence is overwhelming: safe speeds save lives,\" says the Green Party\\'s Transport spokesperson, Julie Anne Genter.\\n\\n\"Our kids should be free to walk and cycle to school without worry.

It is characterised by irregular ovulation, often resulting in infertility.\\n\\nWomen with PCOS may have ovaries containing numerous small cystic structures. PCOS is the leading cause of anovulation and a major contributor to female infertility, affecting between 40 percent and 80 percent of women with the condition.\\n\\nThe prevalence of PCOS and its associated infertility rates are substantial.\\n\\nThe impact of PCOS on menstruation and fertility is profound. In a typical menstrual cycle, a mature follicle develops, leading to ovulation. If pregnancy does not occur, a woman would expect to have a menstrual period approximately 14 days after ovulation.\\n\\nThe primary difference between polycystic ovaries and normal ovaries lies in the development of follicles. While polycystic ovaries contain numerous small follicles with eggs, these follicles often fail to mature properly, preventing ovulation.\\n\\nWithout regular ovulation, menstrual periods become irregular or absent, and pregnancy becomes difficult or impossible. If you are a woman with PCOS, you would frequently experience abnormal bleeding, infertility, obesity, excess hair growth, hair loss, and acne.\\n\\nSome women with PCOS may ovulate occasionally or not at all, making conception challenging and often requiring medical intervention to improve fertility.\\n\\nHormones, such as testosterone and rostenedione, lead to increased facial and body hair growth (hirsutism). While depression is a potential side effect of PCOS, it may not manifest physically or psychologically in all individuals.\\n\\nIt is important to note that not all women with PCOS exhibit obvious signs or symptoms. Some women may remain unaware of their condition until they undergo fertility testing. Additionally, while approximately half of women with PCOS are overweight, the other half may maintain a normal weight.\\n\\nThe relationship between PCOS and obesity is complex. While weight gain can exacerbate PCOS symptoms, it is not the primary cause of the condition. It is a fact that many women with PCOS maintain a normal weight.\\n\\nInsulin resistance, a common feature of PCOS, may contribute to weight gain and difficulty in losing weight. As a PCOS patient, you can consult with a regular obstetrician, but if you are diagnosed with severe insulin resistance, diabetes, or high blood pressure, you would certainly require the expertise of a high-risk obstetrician.\\n\\nFertility testing is recommended for you with PCOS, even if a previous diagnosis has been made. This is important for both you and your partner to understand your fertility status.\\n\\nUndergoing fertility assessments for both of you can identify additional factors that may contribute to infertility, such as male infertility, which may also require treatment.\\n\\nThe likelihood of conceiving with a PCOS diagnosis is relatively high. So if you have PCOS, you can successfully have a baby through fertility treatments. If you are under 35 with PCOS, the primary question is not whether treatment can work but rather which treatment option will be most effective for you.\\n\\nThere is no cure for PCOS presently, but some women do have a normalisation of cycles after a pregnancy. Those with fertility problems may find it easier to get pregnant again. Many medications can be used to control PCOS symptoms, and some may be used in combination with each other.\\n\\nThe best course of action depends on individual needs. PCOS may worsen during the prime reproductive years, ages 20-40, especially with weight gain. A healthy lifestyle is probably the best defense.\\n\\nIt seems as women approach menopause that the severity of PCOS improves, as judged by hormonal parameters. Treatment for PCOS and infertility often begins with ultrasound diagnosis. In a polycystic ovary, the numerous small cystic structures, give the ovaries a characteristic \"polycystic\" (many cysts) appearance on ultrasound.\\n\\nAfter reviewing your medical history, the physician will determine which tests are necessary. If you have irregular or absent menstrual periods, clues from the physical examination will be considered next.\\n\\nYour height and weight will be noted along with any increased facial or body hair or loss of scalp hair, acne and as well as a discoloration of the skin under the arms, breasts, and in the groin. Elevated androgen levels (male hormones), or testosterone help make the diagnosis.\\n\\nA good option for you as a couple dealing with PCOS is to undergo IVF. How successful IVF will be, though, can depend very much upon your characteristics such as age, length of infertility, and weight.\\n\\nAdditionally, neither IVF nor ovarian stimulation is likely to be successful if you are severely overweight, particularly with a body mass index greater than 30.\\n\\nDespite the problems that can present themselves to you suffering from PCOS, you can still look forward to getting pregnant. A successful pregnancy is entirely possible and has been experienced by numerous women with PCOS.\\n\\nIn fact, for many women, getting pregnant the second time around is much easier. Furthermore, it is not unusual for you with PCOS to notice that your menstrual cycle begins to regulate itself after a pregnancy.\\n\\nThe bottom line: You can get pregnant with PCOS. You will likely need to have moderate weight, balance your blood sugar levels, and treat other PCOS symptoms with healthy lifestyle changes and medications.\\n\\nIn some cases, fertility medications alone will help you get pregnant. If that doesn\\'t work, you may need IVF treatment. But regardless of what treatment you explore, don\\'t lose hope. Success rates are optimistic. In time, you may be smiling, positive pregnancy test in hand.', 'image': 'https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06003853/Abayomi-Ajayi.jpg', 'sentiment': -0.04313725490196074, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340398454', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:01:22Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:00:51Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.7215686440467834, 'url': 'https://punchng.com/policemen-face-trial-over-n1m-extortion-from-corpers/', 'title': 'Policemen face trial over N1m extortion from corpers', 'body': 'The Lagos State Police Command said it has begun the trial of four police officers accused of extorting N1m from three members of the National Youth Service Corps in the Surulere area of the state.\\n\\nOn Thursday evening, an X user, Oluyemi Fasipe, shared that the officers, from Area C Police Command in Surulere, allegedly extorted the sum of N1 million from three members of the National Youth Corps members.\\n\\nIt was gathered that the corps members were stopped along the Surulere expressway before a group of officers surrounded their vehicle and started conducting a search.

X\\'s legal representative in Brazil, Rachel de Oliveira, is also required to pay a fine of 300,000 reals.\\n\\nThe case dates back to April, when de Moraes, the minister of Brazil\\'s supreme court, known as Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), initiated a probe into Musk and X over alleged obstruction of justice.\\n\\nMusk had vowed to defy the court\\'s orders to take down certain accounts in Brazil. He called the court\\'s actions \"censorship,\" and railed online against de Moraes, describing the judge as a \"criminal\" and encouraging the U.S. to end foreign aid to Brazil.\\n\\nIn mid-August, Musk closed down X offices in Brazil. That left his company without a legal representative in the country, a federal requirement for all tech platforms to do business there.\\n\\nBy Aug. 28, de Moraes\\' court threatened a ban and fines if X didn\\'t appoint a legal representative within 24 hours, and if it didn\\'t comply with takedown requests for accounts the court said had engaged in plots to dox or harm federal agents, among other things.\\n\\nEarlier this month, the STF froze the business assets of Musk companies, including both X and satellite internet business Starlink, operating in Brazil. The STF said in court filings that it viewed Starlink parent SpaceX and X as companies that worked together as related parties.\\n\\nMusk wrote in a post on X at that time that, \"Unless the Brazilian government returns the illegally seized property of and SpaceX, we will seek reciprocal seizure of government assets too.\"\\n\\nAs head of the STF, de Moraes has long supported federal regulations to rein in hate speech and misinformation online. His views have garnered pushback from tech companies and far-right officials in the country, along with former President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters.\\n\\nBolsonaro is under investigation, suspected of orchestrating a coup in Brazil after losing the 2022 presidential election to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\\n\\nWhile Musk has called for retribution against de Moraes and Lula, he has worked with and praised Bolsonaro for years.

What are other countries doing about it? | Alan Kohler', 'body': 'Australia is not the only country facing a housing crisis. Alan Kohler takes us on a whistle-stop tour of five governments trying to make homes more affordable\\n\\nAlthough Australians are naturally focused on their own housing misery, the truth is that the crisis is global. Much of the developed world has a dire housing shortage and prices are rapidly becoming unaffordable everywhere, or already are. Leo Tolstoy\\'s maxim \"Happy families are all alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\" applies to each country\\'s problems with housing.\\n\\nLeaving aside the migration and refugee flows that are causing extreme housing shortages in some countries, the number of houses being built in the world is simply falling short of population growth, even though that growth is declining. UN-\\xadHabitat says the world needs to build 96,000 affordable homes every day to house the 3 billion people who will need adequate housing by 2030.\\n\\nAnd just as each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, each country is dealing with housing in its own way - some are doing it well, some not so well. Here are a few of them.\\n\\nNew Zealand\\'s house prices started rising rapidly around 1980 and have since gone from twice average incomes to nine times - a bigger increase than in Australia, but over a longer period. In the past 25 years, Kiwi house prices have even outpaced Australia\\'s.\\n\\nNow the government has introduced funding schemes totalling NZ$3.8bn to unlock more land for housing development by supporting infrastructure, and has enacted the Infrastructure Funding and Financing Act 2020 to help developers raise long-\\xadterm financing for infrastructure to support new housing.\\n\\nTo try to dampen demand, the government has also tightened loan-\\xadto-\\xadvalue ratio restrictions on the banks, and the NZ Reserve Bank has raised the official cash rate to bring inflation down, but also to curb highly leveraged borrowing. Furthermore, some new interest deductibility rules have been introduced to discourage property investment, and overseas investment legislation was reviewed in 2018 to restrict foreign buyers of residential land, except for citizens and residents of Australia and Singapore (Peter Dutton would approve).\\n\\nBut the most interesting thing going on in New Zealand was a zoning experiment in Auckland in 2016, in which the council removed restrictions in some areas, opening up suburban blocks to higher-\\xaddensity housing. It was a huge success, at least in terms of housing supply in those areas (although they found out later what the local residents thought - there was, of course, a backlash).\\n\\nIt was so successful that the Labour government decided to bring it in for the whole country, but then it lost the 2023 election and the incoming National government, which had earlier supported the legislation, reversed its stance during the campaign and then duly repealed most of it. The Nationals justified the reversal by claiming they \"got it wrong\" on the medium density residential standards and were responding to concerns from suburban residents opposed to densification in their neighbourhoods. Yes, Nimbyism at work - one of the most powerful forces in the world pushing up house prices.\\n\\nJapan has seen remarkable success in supplying affordable housing - even in the major cities. Thirty years ago, property in Tokyo was the most expensive in the world. Then there was a devastating crash which is still reverberating today, but other countries have caught up and gone past, so Japanese housing is relatively affordable. While average rents in Sydney are more than A$3,000 per month, in Tokyo they\\'re about $2,500. The median dwelling price in Sydney is $1.156m; in Tokyo it\\'s 70m yen, or $680,000.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the result of government-\\xadbuilt social housing, or danchi as it\\'s called - less than 5%of homes across Japan are socially rented. It\\'s simply because they build a lot more houses. The houses are much smaller, of course - 94.85 sq metres on average versus 252 sq metres in Australia - but that\\'s partly because they\\'re building a lot more one-\\xadbedroom flats for singles and young couples, who more often live alone rather than sharing.\\n\\nThe planning system behind this is simple zoning that promotes across-\\xadthe-\\xadboard development rather than granting planning permission for each individual site. There are 12 zones, each defined by the nuisance level they allow, ranging from residential to industrial. It means pretty much anything can be built, provided it does not exceed that zone\\'s nuisance level. So supply can respond quickly as demand changes and ensures development and density is driven by land values. If the demand increases, old houses can easily be knocked down to increase density.\\n\\nAnother factor promoting the building of new homes is tax: the valuation of land and buildings for property taxes, or rates, paid to local councils declines over time, which increases the incentive for the councils to approve new houses to get their rates back up.\\n\\nAustrians pay a housing tax of about 1% of in\\xad\\xadcome and employers contribute as well. The money from the tax is then distributed among the nine Austrian provinces.\\n\\nThere are various kinds of housing that are either fully owned by the City of Vienna, which are called Gemeindebauten or \"communal buildings\", or where the city government provides funding to not-\\xadfor-\\xadprofit deve\\xadlopers to build rent-\\xadcontrolled flats. Both are available to people below a certain income level; the Gemeindebauten apartments don\\'t require a deposit, while the rent-\\xadcontrolled flats sometimes do require deposits of between โฌ10,000 and โฌ20,000, which are returned when the tenant moves out.\\n\\nAt the moment, Gemeindebauten and rent-\\xadcontrolled flats are available for people with an annual net income of less than โฌ79,490 in a two-\\xadperson household, which is almost โฌ30,000 more than Austria\\'s average income. There\\'s no shame in renting these places - even people on fairly decent incomes regard it as a chance to live well at an affordable rent. Apparently Gemeindebauten and rent-\\xadcontrolled flats are even better than private housing in some respects, including playgrounds, community rooms and community gardening.\\n\\nThe Netherlands, in particular Amsterdam, has an absolutely dire housing crisis, with the median price now more than 10 times income. By the end of 2023 the average Dutch house cost โฌ452,000, versus the average salary of โฌ44,000. House prices have more than doubled in the past decade and in some areas have risen 130%. Rents are โฌ1,500 to โฌ3,000 a month - almost as much as in Sydney!\\n\\nThe reason the Netherlands is in such a pickle is something Australians well understand: the government has been stimulating demand while not doing anything about supply.\\n\\nAcademic Gregory Fuller of Groningen University said recently: \"The key features of the housing crisis - rising prices, increasing inequality, shortages of affordable homes and foreign investors infiltrating the market - are the result of decades of dubious housing policies.\"\\n\\nA pro-\\xadmarket Dutch government in effect abolished the housing and planning ministry in the early 2010s and freed up sales of housing corporation stock. Partly as a result, about 25% of homes in the country\\'s four big cities are owned by investors. Further driving up prices are measures such as mortgage tax relief for buyers, and others - meant to aid young buyers - that have instead ended up helping existing owners invest in more property. At the same time, subsidies for house building all but dried up.\\n\\nAfter far-\\xadright politicians such as Geert Wilders blamed migrants and asylum seekers for the crisis, a special rapporteur for the United Nations, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, visited the Netherlands and said Dutch government policy choices were to blame for the country\\'s housing crisis, not asylum seekers or migrant workers. \"An alternative narrative has emerged in the Netherlands that an \\'influx of foreigners\\' is responsible,\" Rajagopal said. The crisis - of both affordability and availability - had, he added, been \"two or more decades\" in the making. Among other factors, he blamed a lack of regulation of social housing providers, an absence of rent caps in the private sector and \"insufficient attention to the role of speculation and large investors in the real estate market\".\\n\\nSound familiar? Well, the proposed solutions will sound familiar as well. The government aims to build 900,000 new homes by 2030, but construction is be\\xad\\xadhind schedule. They\\'ve also brought in regulations to make renting more secure for tenants and are looking into rent control options.\\n\\nThe house building incentive scheme provided โฌ1bn in grants to municipalities to get them to build more houses; however, a report by the Netherlands court of audit cast some doubt on whether this would lead to more housing being built quickly enough. Nevertheless, the new government plans to press on and allocate another โฌ1bn to the scheme.\\n\\nIn 2022, a law was passed banning buyers of homes below a certain value from renting them out, aimed at increasing housing supply for owner-\\xadoccupiers. But this reduced the number of rental properties and pushed up rents.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s probably fair to say the Dutch are at their wits\\' end, a bit like Australians.\\n\\nHome prices in Colorado increased six\\xadfold in 30 years, outstripping both Florida and California, for the usual reason: demand was greater than supply. Seniors were staying in their houses longer, investors were buying second homes and short-\\xadterm rentals, and millennials were trying to break into the housing market in increasing numbers.\\n\\nThen, on 13 May 2024, Colorado governor Jared Polis signed a bill requiring local governments to plan and zone for more apartments and condominiums near transit stations. On the same day, he signed another law allowing accessory dwelling units - small apartments located on the same lot as a single-\\xadfamily house - to be constructed in large cities and towns. These bills followed others that eliminated minimum vehicle parking requirements for apartments and pre\\xadempted local rules prohibiting people from living with roommates. These changes will make housing more affordable by allowing developers to build more - and more diverse - housing at a lower cost.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b064f11ef2e9dac7e4c66a148778c175d169571/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=3fba16a16b234f9f5372dee8c319f378', 'sentiment': -0.1843137254901961, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340398042', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:01:38Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:00:10Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.6352941393852234, 'url': 'https://theprint.in/india/ukhand-communal-tension-erupts-in-dehradun-after-muslim-girl-found-hanging-with-hindu-boy/2287859/', 'title': \"U'khand: Communal tension erupts in Dehradun after Muslim girl found hanging with Hindu boy\", 'body': 'The girl had allegedly fled her home to meet the boy who works in the Selaqui area near here, he said.\\n\\nUpon reaching Dehradun, she called the boy who came to meet her at the railway station.

White residents also carry about $100 more in debt than residents of color in Washington, a trend that\\'s reversed nationwide.\\n\\nOnly 1% of Washington residents hold delinquent medical debt, opposed to 5% of the nation. Thirteen percent of Washington residents have past-due student loan debt and 3% carry auto or retail loan debt, rates that are both 2% lower than the national average.\\n\\nYoung adults in Washington also have less past-due debt than the national average for young adults. Both Washington\\'s young adults and the nation\\'s are less likely to have unpaid debt than older adults.\\n\\nDelinquency can lead to high fees, increased interest rates, poor credit scores and more, hurting a person\\'s ability to access car and home loans, rent apartments and pay for other living expenses.\\n\\nThe analysis from the public policy think tank uses August 2023 credit bureau data and Census estimates from 2018 to 2022. In its definition of delinquent debt, it includes unpaid bills in collections and past-due credit lines that have been closed and charged off.\\n\\nThat definition may obscure the true levels of debt Washington residents face, said Sam Hatzenbeler, a policy associate at Economic Opportunity Institute, a progressive non-profit group based in Seattle. Medical debt, for example, can come from other sources, like needing to go on a payment plan with a hospital or getting a loan from a friend.\\n\\nA Kaiser Family Foundation report with a broader definition of medical debt using 2019-2021 data found 6.5% of Washington residents have medical debt -- but that number was still comparatively better than the national average in the same report.\\n\\nHatzenbeler said Washington may be doing better compared to the rest of the nation due to policy changes to improve affordability of needed services, like expanding Medicaid.

And making sure they have a healthy, filling breakfast only adds to the challenge. That\\'s why pediatricians feed their kids a few protein-packed nutritious breakfasts on repeat.\\n\\n\"Mornings are always a scramble,\" Dr. Danielle Grant, a pediatrician at Texas Children\\'s Pediatrics and mom of three teenagers, tells TODAY.com. \"As a parent, you\\'re always struggling to make sure they\\'re getting what they need at probably the busiest time in the morning for everybody,\" she says.\\n\\nWhen her kids were younger, Grant navigated their picky toddler tastes. And now that they\\'re older, \"they wake up and they\\'re busy, they\\'re not hungry and they\\'re trying to rush out the door because they overslept,\" she says.\\n\\nBut breakfast doesn\\'t have to be part of the morning\\'s obstacle course. Instead, it can be an opportunity to involve kids in picking and making their meals. And breakfast creates a way to start the whole family\\'s day on the right foot, experts say.\\n\\n\"I really am a firm believer in the egg sandwich,\" Dr. Christina Johns, a senior medical adviser for PM Pediatrics, tells TODAY.com.\\n\\nHer kids, ages 15 and 18, are both athletes who prefer a hot breakfast, so they gravitate towards protein-packed egg and cheese sandwiches most mornings. The sandwiches are a great option, Johns says, because they contain protein, dairy, fiber and carbs -- and have the potential to be customized with other nutritious ingredients.\\n\\nSometimes her kids will have their sandwiches on \"fancy seven-grain panini bread,\" she says. Or they might use a flour tortilla or croissant, and the variety helps keep the meal interesting.\\n\\nJohns also encourages her kids to add other nutritious ingredients to their sandwiches, like avocado or cooked veggies leftover from dinner the night before.\\n\\nFruit is always a health ingredient to add to any meal, and some fruits are more portable than others. For instance, it might not be convenient to sit down with a knife and fork for a slice of watermelon or cantaloupe in the mornings, Johns says.\\n\\nInstead, she \"tries to do things that are easy\" and offers her daughter a banana or a ramekin of berries, like blackberries or blueberries, that she can just grab and eat in the carpool on the way to school.\\n\\nSometimes, children\\'s preferences change quickly. So it helps to have a few standard food options that you can easily adapt to their changing tastes.\\n\\nThat\\'s how Dr. Katie Lockwood, a pediatrician at Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, approaches breakfast with her kids. Her go-to foods are typically high in filling protein. \"I know (protein) will keep them full longer and help give them energy for their busy day,\" Lockwood says.\\n\\nIf they\\'re having baked goods, like a muffin or croissant, she encourages them to have a glass of milk, too, for some protein. And if they\\'re eating a waffle, they smear it with cream cheese or peanut butter.\\n\\nKnowing that mornings don\\'t leave much time for cooking, Grant tries to \"make a game plan the night before,\" which often includes making hard-boiled eggs. That way, her kids can eat the eggs the next day however they want (which often means topping them with everything bagel seasoning.)\\n\\nIf she does happen to have time in the morning, Grant might make poached eggs over whole-grain toast with some avocado.\\n\\nAmy Reed, a registered dietitian at Cincinnati Children\\'s Hospital, typically makes homemade muffins for her two teenage sons.\\n\\n\"I really like to increase the nutritional value of muffins by adding pureed pumpkin, banana, peach, applesauce or carrots,\" she says.\\n\\nShe also uses some whole wheat flour rather than entirely white flour because it has more vitamins, minerals and fiber. But she usually only substitutes half because her kids don\\'t like the muffins when they\\'re entirely whole wheat. \"I try to keep their preferences in mind,\" she explains.\\n\\nAlongside the muffins, Reed encourages her kids to drink milk for some protein. Sometimes she\\'ll steer them towards ultrafiltered milk, which has more protein than regular milk.\\n\\nA balanced dinner includes filling protein, heart-healthy fats and energizing carbohydrates -- along with a good helping of vegetables. All of those things make leftovers the perfect meal to eat in the morning, too!\\n\\n\"There\\'s no shame in dinner for breakfast,\" Dr. Shelly Vaziri Flais, a Chicago-based pediatrician and editor-in-chief of the American Academy of Pediatrics\\' \"Caring For Your School-Age Child,\" tells TODAY.com.\\n\\nA mom of four kids, including twins, Flais always makes extra spaghetti and meatballs so her kids can have it for breakfast the next morning. \"You\\'ve got your protein, and with the tomato sauce, you get some vitamin C in there,\" she says. \"And it\\'s something a little bit more substantial to carry them through the day.\"\\n\\nWhile it\\'s not routine for everyone in the family, Johns says her daughter enjoys heating up the previous night\\'s dinner, such as chicken and rice, for breakfast. \"It sounds perfectly awful to me,\" Johns says, but the meal contains healthy, lean protein so she goes along with it.\\n\\n\"If she\\'s in the mood for chicken with pesto at 9:15 a.m. in the summertime, which she has been recently, more power to her,\" she says.\\n\\nTo get more protein in the mornings, Reed will sometimes make her kids fruit-filled protein smoothies.\\n\\nOne of her go-to recipes includes strawberries, a splash of lemonade with some Greek yogurt, ultrafiltered milk or a bit of protein powder. She\\'ll also sneak in some other fruit occasionally or even a peeled cucumber because \"it\\'s such a hydrating vegetable.\"\\n\\nGrant also gives her kids protein smoothies in the morning, especially if they\\'re not super hungry but still need to eat something before school.\\n\\n\"We like to do a lot of fruit in ours and then a nice source of protein, like peanut butter,\" she says. Their favorite recipe is made with banana (which Grant usually freezes ahead of time), milk, peanut butter and chocolate. But they also like strawberries and banana blended with a bit of vanilla protein powder.\\n\\nFor a more filling twist on a classic breakfast, Flais turns to high-protein waffle mix.\\n\\nShe buys the mix in bulk and, taking a tip from a fellow parent, she adds extra ingredients to further increase the protein content. \"Instead of water, you add milk,\" she explains, \"and then you add an egg for each cup of the mix.\"\\n\\nThe result is a quick meal that\\'s packed with protein and fiber. Flais often makes the waffles for a weekend breakfast, and her kids eat the leftovers the next morning.\\n\\nAnd for a fiber-rich twist on yet another classic breakfast food, the experts recommend making pancakes with whole-grain ingredients.\\n\\nPancakes are relatively quick to make in the morning, Reed says, and offer another opportunity to sneak in some nutrition via gut-healthy whole grains, fruit and applesauce. Johns also makes buckwheat pancakes, which her kids like to eat with banana slices and maple syrup.\\n\\nThe experts say they generally don\\'t make any breakfast foods completely off-limits. But some are saved for weekends when the family can all enjoy the meal together or they\\'re paired with other, more nutrient-dense foods during the week.\\n\\n\"I try not to restrict particular foods,\" Lockwood says, \"but rather advise them that they need to eat things that will help them have energy and the ability to focus throughout the day.\"\\n\\nFor instance, if the child is having something like the occasional breakfast pastry, Reed says she\\'ll encourage them to also have something else -- like a smear of peanut butter on a croissant or eggs on the side with a donut -- to help keep them full.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think we should focus too much on whether or not something is a right or wrong breakfast food, but rather let kids choose things that make them feel good,\" Lockwood says. Reed also notes that her kids are old enough to start making connections on their own between what they eat and how they feel or how well they perform at after-school swim meets.\\n\\nThe experts try not to let their kids leave home in the morning without eating something.\\n\\nDepending on when kids normally have lunch, they may be able to get away with something smaller in the morning, like a glass of milk or a granola bar, Reed says, noting that some school lunches can be as early as 10 a.m.\\n\\nBut if they\\'re having lunch later in the afternoon, then it\\'s a good idea for them to have something more substantial, like peanut butter and jelly in a tortilla on the way to the bus, Reed suggests, or a smoothie, Lockwood says.\\n\\nEating a regular breakfast, along with water, is also important for gastrointestinal health, Flais says. \"I see so many young children with abdominal pain and constipation issues, and part of that is eating infrequently or eating a ton at once and then not much at other times of the day,\" she explains.\\n\\n\"Parenting is hard, and a struggle over breakfast can set a negative tone for your and your children\\'s day,\" Lockwood says.\\n\\nJohns, who had a tough time getting one of her kids to eat breakfast when they were younger, encourages parents to give themselves grace when challenges arise around eating.\\n\\nLockwood agrees: \"If you are offering a variety of foods throughout the day and your child is growing well, don\\'t worry if your child\\'s breakfast isn\\'t as much or as varied as you want it to be,\" she adds. \"Model eating a variety of foods yourself, and use breakfast as a time to chat and bond with your child before the day ahead.\"\\n\\nGrant and Johns also suggest involving kids in meal prep. For younger kids, Johns recommends prompting them to pick out the specific berries they want to eat.

I certainly know a lot of the people over there, I know a lot of the players over there, but I think there\\'s been enough distance at this point.\"\\n\\nStearns joined the Brewers in October 2015 as general manager and was promoted to president of baseball operations before the 2019 season. He stepped down after the 2022 season and remained with the Brewers in an advisory role while Matt Arnold -- his former right-hand man -- took over as president of baseball operations. Stearns left Milwaukee entirely last fall to run baseball operations for the team he rooted for as a kid growing up in New York City.\\n\\nHe believed this was his first time back at American Family Field since August 2023. The Brewers opened the season by sweeping the Mets in New York, but the teams hadn\\'t faced each other since.\\n\\nNow they\\'re meeting again with the Mets\\' season on the line. New York entered Friday just ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks for the second of three National League wild cards, with the Atlanta Braves one game behind both.\\n\\nAs Stearns noted, the Brewers\\' roster has changed quite a bit since he departed. Milwaukee\\'s starting lineup Friday included only four players -- second baseman Brice Turang, right fielder Sal Frelick, left fielder Jackson Chourio and shortstop Willy Adames -- who joined the organization when Stearns was in charge.\\n\\nEven so, Stearns played a major role in helping the Brewers put together the longest sustained run of success in franchise history. Milwaukee clinched the NL Central title last week and will be making its sixth playoff appearance in the last seven years. That run of postseason bids came shortly after Stearns engineered the blockbuster acquisition of Christian Yelich, the 2018 NL MVP.\\n\\nMilwaukee had made the playoffs just twice in a 35-year stretch from 1983-2017.\\n\\n\"It\\'s fun being back here,\" Stearns said. \"I\\'m glad I\\'m back here when games really matter for us. We\\'re playing for something that\\'s really important, so we have to go out and have a good series.\"\\n\\nStearns is now trying to get back in the playoffs with the Mets, which could result in a return to Milwaukee next month. But that path just got quite a bit more complicated.\\n\\nThe Mets face the possibility of playing a doubleheader in Atlanta on Monday -- the day after the scheduled end of the regular season -- for the right to begin a Wild Card Series on Tuesday. That scenario developed because New York\\'s scheduled Wednesday and Thursday games in Atlanta were rained out.\\n\\n\"Nobody wants to play a doubleheader on Monday,\" Stearns said. \"The Braves didn\\'t want that outcome, MLB didn\\'t want that outcome and certainly we didn\\'t want that outcome. I think it\\'s easy in retrospect to say that we could have done things differently to get there. It\\'s also really tough in the moment to predict exactly what the weather is going to do. There are a whole host of considerations that everyone is working through in order to make the best decision possible.\\n\\n\"The reality is we may have to play a doubleheader on Monday, and if we do, we\\'ll do the best that we can.\"\\n\\nStearns was asked if he believed the start of a Wild Card Series should be pushed back a day if that Monday doubleheader takes place. The twinbill would only happen if the Mets\\' and Braves\\' playoff fates aren\\'t settled by then.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not my decision, and so I\\'m not really thinking about it,\" Stearns said. \"Whenever we play, we play.\"\\n\\nIf New York ends up as the third NL wild card, Stearns would be seeing his former team again with even more at stake as the Mets and Brewers square off in a best-of-three series.\\n\\n\"Our focus is on to get into the playoffs,\" Stearns said. \"If we get into the playoffs, we\\'ll play whoever we need to play.\"\\n\\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB\\n\\nSteve Megargee, The Associated Press', 'image': 'https://www.vmcdn.ca/files/victoriatimescolonist/images/static-images/tc-flag-crest.png', 'sentiment': 0.09019607843137245, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340398817', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:01:49Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:01:30Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.thephinsider.com/2024/9/27/24255905/phinsider-victory-of-the-week-open-thread-vol-603', 'title': 'Phinsider Victory Of The Week Open Thread Vol. 603', 'body': \"It's Friday, so it's time for us to welcome you to another VOTW post.

Campbell realized that they were calling him \"Barry\" after the famed (controversial) slugger Barry Bonds, whose 762 career home runs stand atop MLB\\'s all-time list.\\n\\n\"We were in the locker room, and they just started kind of calling me \\'Barry,\\' and I\\'d never answer because I didn\\'t know what they were talking about,\" Campbell explained. \"They kept doing it for like, two or three days, and I started answering, and the nickname just kind of stuck.\"\\n\\nConcerns over where Campbell fits into the current Red Sox defense are virtually nonexistent. He\\'s incredibly versatile, and confident in his abilities to move around.\\n\\n\"I play everywhere pretty well. I play middle infielder, center, I can play the corners, too, and a little bit of third base. I feel pretty comfortable everywhere on the field,\" he said. \"I\\'m primarily a middle infielder and I feel really comfortable at second base, that\\'s been my spot the last couple years. This year I moved all over the place and I felt really good.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s something that impressed Triple-A manager Chad Tracy immediately.\\n\\n\"Second baseman, maybe, third baseman, maybe centerfielder, short. He probably could play any one of them at this point,\" Tracy said at the end of August. \"He covers ground out there (in the outfield). ... At short, he looks smooth, really smooth.\"\\n\\n\"Just a good athlete. A good athlete who has versatility, he can impact the baseball,\" said manager Alex Cora on Friday. \"We\\'re very pleased with the season he had, obviously putting himself on the radar. He worked hard for it, and he\\'s an interesting player, and a good one.\"\\n\\nCampbell is no stranger to Green Monsters. The organization\\'s spring training facility in Fort Myers has a replica, as do two of the three levels Campbell played at this year.\\n\\nBut nothing compares to the original verdant behemoth in Boston, which Campbell got to see for the first time on Friday.\\n\\n\"It\\'s good, it\\'s big! We had it in Greenville and Portland,\" he said. \"This one\\'s definitely a little bigger, and it\\'s a lot brighter.\"\\n\\nHow fitting for a season, and future, bigger and brighter than he expected.\\n\\nTwo of Boston\\'s top prospects, shortstop Marcelo Mayer and outfielder Braden Montgomery, finished the season on the injured list, but Red Sox director of player development Brian Abraham provided a positive update on both prior to Friday\\'s game.\\n\\n\"Marcelo is doing well, he\\'s back home progressing really well,\" Abraham said of Mayer, the No. 10 ranked prospect in MLB according to Baseball America. \"He\\'ll soon be ramping up baseball activity but a full offseason of health and preparation for next year\\'s spring training.\"\\n\\nMayer was promoted to Triple-A in August but was shut down due to a lumbar strain before playing a game in Worcester. Meanwhile, Montgomery, who was drafted No. 12 overall by the Red Sox out of Texas A&M in this summer\\'s draft, suffered a broken ankle in the NCAA Tournament and has been recovering ever since.\\n\\nAbraham said Montgomery has been on a strength and conditioning program and recently started swinging, and the expectation is he\\'ll remain in Fort Myers for the time being as he keeps working on his rehab.\\n\\n\"We\\'re really excited to see him get on the field and the progress he\\'s going to make,\" Abraham said.\\n\\nMontgomery currently ranks as the No. 59 prospect in MLB despite still having yet to make his pro debut.\\n\\nThe Salem Red Sox, based out of Salem, Virginia, have served as a Single-A affiliate for Boston since 2009, but with the club\\'s lease at Salem Memorial Stadium due to expire following the season, questions have lingered about the club\\'s future.\\n\\nThough a new lease hasn\\'t been signed, Peter Freund, CEO of club owner Diamond Baseball Holdings, said Friday that they expect a deal will be reached and that the franchise will remain in Salem.\\n\\n\"We are in discussions with the City of Salem on lease drafts and intend to enter into a new lease prior to the 2025 season,\" Freund told the Herald.\\n\\nThe Salem Red Sox currently serve as Boston\\'s Low-A affiliate in the Carolina League.

He called the court\\'s actions \"censorship,\" and railed online against de Moraes, describing the judge as a \"criminal\" and encouraging the U.S. to end foreign aid to Brazil.\\n\\nIn mid-August, Musk closed down X offices in Brazil. That left his company without a legal representative in the country, a federal requirement for all tech platforms to do business there.\\n\\nBy Aug. 28, de Moraes\\' court threatened a ban and fines if X didn\\'t appoint a legal representative within 24 hours, and if it didn\\'t comply with takedown requests for accounts the court said had engaged in plots to dox or harm federal agents, among other things.\\n\\nEarlier this month, the STF froze the business assets of Musk companies, including both X and satellite internet business Starlink, operating in Brazil. The STF said in court filings that it viewed Starlink parent SpaceX and X as companies that worked together as related parties.\\n\\nMusk wrote in a post on X at that time that, \"Unless the Brazilian government returns the illegally seized property of and SpaceX, we will seek reciprocal seizure of government assets too.\"\\n\\nAs head of the STF, de Moraes has long supported federal regulations to rein in hate speech and misinformation online.

According to a rudimentary internet search, Dr. Pradelle had never published before. Subsequently, listed authors were degreed as physicians, pharmacists, and/or professors of their respective disciplines. The main, corresponding author, Jean-Christophe Lega, runs the Evaluation and Modeling of Therapeutic Effects team at the University of Lyon.\\n\\nIn addition to being a hypothesized estimate, the article also attacked the legendary safety of HCQ, contradicting centuries of the safety of quinolines as a class.\\n\\nHCQ, chloroquine and quinine are structurally and pharmaceutically/mechanistically related, sharing the same quinoline structural group. The original iteration of quinine was a very fortunate discovery that dates back to the 1600s (at least) as a medicinal tipple used by Jesuit missionaries in South America. It is naturally found in the bark of the Cinchona tree (also called a \"Quina-Quina\" tree).\\n\\nQuinine is still available today both as a prescription drug, for similar indications as HCQ including malaria...and as a Covid-19 treatment.\\n\\nQuinine is so safe that it may be unique in that the FDA simultaneously permits its use without a prescription, as an ingredient in tonic waters.\\n\\nHCQ is similarly safe when used appropriately and under medical supervision.\\n\\nThese are pharmacology fundamentals that ought to be known by any pharmacist or physician - let alone to a professor serving as a Journal Editor-in-Chief at a taxpayer-funded state College of Pharmacy.\\n\\nDid not even one person on her editorial board of over 50 \"peer-reviewers\" and staff ponder the celebrated and storied history of HCQ (and its predecessors) and how incongruent this study\\'s findings were before choosing to publish data denigrating HCQ safety?\\n\\nThe correct answer to that might actually be: \"no\"...\\n\\nThe publishing editorial board all seem to be laboratory bench (non-clinical) research scientists, per their biographies. Although the board does promote itself as meeting DEI requirements of being \"gender diverse,\" a more important question might be is if they have the appropriate credentials and experience to review and opine on clinically complex drug safety/epidemiology subject matters in the first place.\\n\\nIs just anyone now allowed to opine on specialty clinical pharmacology drug safety matters?\\n\\nIn certain journals/news publications, the answer to that question seems to be: \"yes\"...\\n\\nAnother point of confusion surrounded the interpretation and promotion of this little-known publication by the lay press.\\n\\nTo be exact: there were never \"17,000 deaths;\" it was always a hypothetical extrapolation of people that could have died, based on \"unreliable\" (eg, actually, fraudulent) databases on top of the previously mentioned, problematic late-stage RECOVERY-trial-type dosing and timing.\\n\\nStill, Josh Cohen, a Forbes.com PhD senior healthcare columnist, used this publication to headline an absurdly biased op-ed against HCQ, stating that Trump\\'s HCQ proposal was \"Linked To 17,000 Deaths.\" Forbes\\' Tufts, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania- trained \"healthcare analyst\" misrepresented or appeared to not understand the now-retracted study methodology or projections.\\n\\nHere are some screenshots of headlines referencing non-existent deaths based on a now-retracted study:\\n\\nAlmost immediately following the January 2, 2024 publication, its critical flaws including basic miscalculations among many other deficiencies were brought to the attention of Dr. Townsend by Xavier Azalbert and non-profit BonSens.org attorneys starting on Jan 7, 2024. In fact, a total of 9 communications were sent by the above individuals, but none of them were ever shared as \"Letters to The Editor\" by Dr. Townsend in good faith to inform readers of specific potential shortcomings, as is otherwise commonly done.\\n\\nDr. Townsend seemed to forget that bad medical data and publications can do actual patient harm, and kept legitimate and important study criticisms to herself. Instead of taking responsibility and making a leadership decision, she passed the buck to a Committee on Publication Ethics, delaying the needed retraction.\\n\\nIt appallingly took 234 days (~7 months, from the January 2nd publication to August 26th) for Dr. Townsend\\'s Journal of Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy to finally retract the \"unreliable\" article. But at that point, untold millions around the world had already been (and continue to be) polluted with outrageously incorrect information about non-existent HCQ deaths.\\n\\nEthical scientists who believe in truth, transparency, and academic accountability are standing by, waiting for medical and academic justice.\\n\\nUnethical scientists are also watching this situation unfold, twisting their mustaches, learning about what they could potentially one day get away with.', 'image': 'https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Shutterstock_1406984654-2-1536x900.jpg?itok=CsptZZ8h', 'sentiment': 0.2549019607843137, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340399270', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:02:26Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:02:05Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.7215686440467834, 'url': 'https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/nation_and_world/nation/photo-collection-mexico-first-woman-president/article_7527bf2e-85ea-526d-9e0c-4f9fbeeab569.html', 'title': 'PHOTO COLLECTION: Mexico First Woman President', 'body': \"FILE - Claudia Sheinbaum raises a fist as she is driven away from a polling station where she voted in the general elections in Mexico City, June 2, 2024.

Bluth and his talented teams produced the animated classics The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go to Heaven, and Anastasia, as well as such video games as Dragon\\'s Lair. Recently, Bluth published Yuki, Star of the Sea, the first book in a planned series of children\\'s fables. BookLife named it an Editor\\'s Pick and praised Bluth\\'s illustrations. We spoke to Bluth about creativity, his writing, and the message behind the book.\\n\\nMany of your projects place you as an artist first. How has your relationship to writing evolved over the years?\\n\\nI am, by nature, blessed with a driving curiosity, particularly when it comes to the nature of mankind. My dad was a policeman in El Paso, Texas. He spoke often about what makes people behave as they do: nurture or nature?\\n\\nI\\'ve always been an artist, one who pursued anything beautiful. That was my God-given talent, and it came naturally. I drew as I pleased. In college, I stayed away from the art department. I resolved to find my own way in that regard. So what did I do? I majored in English. I had no idea what I was getting into at the time, but suddenly I was overwhelmed with reading assignments, and although it was exhausting, it opened up a whole new world.\\n\\nOver the years, I began to see that my drawings were void of any meaning, but the messages in the books I read were not. I put the two worlds together. My new approach to art went far beyond being just cute or anatomically correct or a wonderful graphic design. Every drawing became a metaphor or a simile for an idea.\\n\\nIs there a character that you\\'ve created who you feel resonates just as easily with people today as they did when they were created?\\n\\nOh my, yes. I\\'m thinking of Dirk the Daring from the 1980s video game Dragon\\'s Lair. That spunky little knight is as dumb as a bag of hammers, yet when it comes to the challenge of rescuing the princess, Daphne, he somehow manages to win. Wasn\\'t that the formula for [Chaplin\\'s] the Little Tramp? What a loving character he was. I see those tendencies in my own life. What I mean is: I am both a genius and an idiot. The success of my characters, and there are thousands of them, is the fact that they reflect human nature.\\n\\nYuki, Star of the Sea is the only fiction work you\\'ve released. Is there a reason you haven\\'t written more fiction?\\n\\nOld-fashioned animation is still my first love. However, when the computers moved in, the pencils moved out. I\\'ve spent some time being sad about this, but I\\'m here, and I can still communicate with my drawings. I hope 2D animation gets a renaissance, I really do. Meanwhile, I have stories in my head that need to be told and published. I will write and illustrate books.\\n\\nWhat inspired the conservation message at the heart of Yuki, Star of the Sea?\\n\\nThe Earth with its ecosystem and all its creatures that live on the planet are sacred subjects to me. Everything is beautiful in its own way, and yet death is ever-present. I am saddened by the pain and suffering that I see around me, and I refuse to be a mere witness to all that. I am here to help Mother Nature. Yuki, the little whale, belongs in the sea, and not in a tank in Mexico.\\n\\nDo you have any advice for artists today?\\n\\nYou must see yourself first as an entertainer -- one who can tell a joke and people will laugh, or one who tell can tell a story and people will smile, one who can sketch a drawing and someone wants to buy it.\\n\\nInside each of us is a creative light that wants to shine. If your light is about creating characters with a pencil, then you must do more than simply want it. When I draw, I never settle for just okay. And, if it turns out to be not okay, I keep drawing until it is. I know this sounds like work, but it\\'s the only way, and you can apply this rule to any medium.\\n\\nThe book\\'s subtitle is \"A Don Bluth Fable.\" Can readers expect more fables in the future?\\n\\nFunny that you should ask. Currently, I have eight books on the board. Although I am now in the autumn of my years, that creative light inside me shines on. My joy comes from seeing people smile.\\n\\nDrucilla Shultz is a bookseller and freelance editor with over a decade of publishing industry experience.', 'image': 'https://www.publishersweekly.com/images/data/ARTICLE_PHOTO/photo/000/114/114278-1.JPG', 'sentiment': 0.3098039215686275, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340399316', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:02:28Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:02:08Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0.5058823823928833, 'url': 'https://www.fool.ca/2024/09/27/this-tsx-dividend-stock-pays-5-in-monthly-cash/', 'title': 'This TSX Dividend Stock Pays 5% in Monthly Cash', 'body': \"One of the most coveted elements of investing is receiving a dividend.

Often, these have no or extremely limited competition, which provides an element of appeal.\\n\\nThis not only provides a defensive moat for the company, but can be a lucrative source of revenue\\n\\nBy way of example, let's look at the aviation segment. Exchange's subsidiaries there provide passenger, cargo, and medevac service to the remote regions of Canada's north. Turning to the manufacturing segment, examples include custom manufacturing services for the defence market as well as cell tower fabrication services.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons why investors flock to Exchange is for that lucrative monthly payout. As of the time of writing, Exchange offers a juicy 5.5% yield. This makes the TSX dividend stock one of the better-paying options to consider right now.\\n\\nThat tasty yield also means that investors with $30,000 to invest can expect to earn $125 every month from Exchange. Even better, investors who aren't ready to draw on that income yet can choose to reinvest that dividend. This allows it to grow further over a longer period of time.\\n\\nSpeaking of growth, Exchange continues to provide annual generous upticks to that dividend. In fact, the company has provided increases to that monthly cash dividend for 17 of the last 19 years.\\n\\nThat fact alone makes Exchange a great buy-and-forget TSX dividend stock to consider for your portfolio.\\n\\nNo stock even the most defensive is not without some risk, and that includes Exchange. Fortunately, Exchange is a well-diversified option that can provide years of opportunity for growth and income-seeking investors alike.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Exchange should be a core holding as part of any long-term well-diversified portfolio.\\n\\nBuy this TSX dividend stock today, hold it, and watch it (and your future income) grow.\", 'image': 'https://www.fool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Slide-8.jpg', 'sentiment': 0.1450980392156862, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340398992', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:02:28Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:01:44Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/sexual-assault-sentence-arapahoe-county-colorado/73-1a0a4b4f-6ae0-4987-9ce0-08e4bca53a52', 'title': 'Man who sexually assaulted woman at gunpoint sentenced to 30 years', 'body': \"CENTENNIAL, Colo. -- Editor's note: The story below includes details about a sexual assault that readers might find disturbing.\\n\\nA man accused of sexually assaulting a woman in her car at gunpoint was sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison.\\n\\nHilton Acker, 34, pleaded guilty in July to second-degree kidnapping in Arapahoe County court as part of a plea agreement. Court records show a sentence enhancer of using a weapon in a violent crime was proven.\\n\\nIn January 2023, the victim said she was driving on South Alton Street between East Mississippi Avenue and East Florida Avenue, which is near Aurora, when she was flagged down by a man she did not know.\\n\\nShe reported to police that the man was waving and holding a cup of coffee. She pulled over and the man began knocking on the passenger side window, the arrest affidavit says. She rolled down the window, and the man pointed a gun at her.\\n\\nHe told her to open the door, which she said she did out of fear for her safety. She said he ordered her to drive, and after about five minutes, they ended up in alley, where the victim reported that the man forced her to perform a sex act on him at gunpoint, the affidavit says.\\n\\nShe reported that afterward, the man got into the front seat and drove them around for about 30 minutes before stopping.\\n\\nShe reported that the man raped her in the back seat. She said they drove to a neighborhood where the man stole her phone and ran from the vehicle, the affidavit says.\\n\\nShe said she drove out of the neighborhood to find a gas station to ask for directions because she did not know where she was and arrived home about 5 a.m.\\n\\nInvestigators later spoke with the victim's partner, who said he was working as a bartender until about 3:30 a.m. He reported that she had stopped texting him around 2:30 a.m. and was crying when she got home and immediately went to take a shower.\\n\\nWhen she got out, she told him what happened, the affidavit says. The man used the find-my-phone feature and located her phone in Green Valley Ranch. The victim was later able to identify a business on East 34th Drive as the location where she was assaulted.

It's taken me countless hours, many pointless side quests and one Merlin Trial. But I enjoyed my time with it. It has too many flaws though.\\n\\nWhere do I start? Maybe the Merlin Trials being so pointless and a waste of time. I only did the one trial, when I got introduced to it, and ignored it completely after that. Why should I waste my time with expanding my gear slots when the rewards are worthless clothing items?\\n\\nHogwarts itself is just a beautiful centrepiece but there's no requirement at all to actually be there or even bother with it. You can skip days, skip classes, and even journey further away from it. There are no consequences at all and the castle itself is littered with stairs, lifeless students, and repeating lines of dialogue.\\n\\nThere's also the fact that the classes are two minutes long. You learn a new spell and that's it. You never need to worry about it ever again. You spend more time carrying out assignments outside of Hogwarts than attending classes, or even caring about Hogwarts.\\n\\nSummoner's Court is a waste of time. The duelling club is five minutes long and is never brought up again. You can't attend the feasts. Even the end of year feast is locked off to you. There're no house points. The Unforgivable Curses are pointless. You can cast Crucio as many times as you like. Azkaban is an afterthought. No consequences at all. There's more. The fact that Quidditch was saved for another game and more cash to pay for it is shameful.\\n\\nThe rewards for every dungeon is just more clothing items. The Forbidden Forest is just filled with the same types of enemies. Spiders. Trolls. Poachers. They just come across as bullet sponges and that applies for the trolls. They become tedious tasks and it just gets boring.\\n\\nThe enemies repeat the same lines and even characters such as Harlow and Rookwood are extremely boring. Their fights are less than five minutes long. The final fight is just boredom. Even the professors are just forgettable.\\n\\nThe beasts aspect of the game is pointless. It only serves to introduce Poppy, and I do like her, but she's only there for her questline and then forgotten about. Same for Natty and Sebastian. Sebastian was my favourite companion in the game, but I know his story is finished and I'll never be able to speak to him again. There's also the fact that the common rooms are more pointless than Hogwarts itself. You travel there for the first time and it just becomes absolutely worthless.\\n\\nIt's empty as hell, you can't even sleep in your own bed and there's no motivation to even visit the common room. It looks nice and it's a great introduction to the three best Slytherin characters: Ominis, Imelda, and Sebastian. I loved all three of them and I was proud of choosing Slytherin as my house. But that was ultimately a waste of breath because you're locked down as the hero of Hogwarts and you can't actually be evil.\\n\\nLike I mentioned before, there's no consequences and no one is phased by you knowing and using Avada Kedavra. Only Sebastian faces the consequences. I didn't actually expose him and that wasn't an issue because it never gets brought up again. Just a final conversation with him. That's it.\\n\\nI've said enough but this was a good game. It could have been great. I hope Avalanche takes the criticisms on board because I'd be glad to see a sequel and continue the journey of my character named Marguerite Vasilisa.\\n\\nAlso, on a final note. You don't even take your O.W.L.s. So, you'll never know your career path. But you win the House Cup. Which is pointless. So that's something.\\n\\nBy reader Shahzaib Sadiq\\n\\nThe reader's features do not necessarily represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\", 'image': 'https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SEI_221102244-18c7.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C38px%2C1920px%2C1008px&resize=1200%2C630', 'sentiment': -0.1607843137254902, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340399071', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:02:29Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:01:54Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.publishersweekly.com:443/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/96040-richard-price-s-true-grit.html', 'title': \"Richard Price's True Grit\", 'body': 'Despite his success -- bestselling books, awards, film adaptations, critical acclaim -- Richard Price, who typically works seven days a week, admits he doesn\\'t enjoy writing all that much.\\n\\n\"If someone could give me a pill that would make me unconscious and my head would fall on a piece of paper and, when I came to, lo and behold, there was a manuscript here, that would be great,\" Price, dressed in a white button down, says via Zoom from his desk at the top of the Harlem brownstone where he\\'s lived since 2008. \"But there\\'s no such pill.\"\\n\\nPrice writes about social issues around violence, drugs, race, and identity with unparalleled precision, and counts James Baldwin\\'s Go Tell It on the Mountain and Lenny Bruce\\'s stand-up among his early influences. His nine previous novels -- including The Wanderers, his 1974 debut about a Bronx gang; Clockers, a seminal book about cops and crack dealers in fictional Dempsey, N.J., which became a Spike Lee movie; and Lush Life, a crime story set on the Lower East Side in the early aughts -- have been translated into more than 15 languages. His screen credits include The Color of Money, for which he received an Academy Award nomination, and the HBO series The Night Of.\\n\\nAnd while he continues to juggle books and scripts, he insists, \"I\\'m a novelist first, no matter how many screenplays I write.\" His new novel, Lazarus Man (FSG, Nov.), is his first in nearly 10 years. It\\'s a big-canvas novel about second chances and lost love that\\'s also one of his most sensitive. Set in 2008 in East Harlem, it focuses on four characters whose lives are impacted by the collapse of a tenement building that kills several inhabitants and leaves others missing.\\n\\nPrice was born in the Bronx in 1949 and grew up in a housing project, where he was nicknamed Mr. Vocabulary. He has cerebral palsy -- the result of a breech birth -- a condition that affected his muscles and has left him with limited use of his right hand. \"My grandma used to say, \\'Okay, you\\'re a little bit of a cripple, but goddamn you have a mind on you, boy,\\'\\u2009\" Price says. \"If my hand wasn\\'t messed up, I don\\'t know if I would\\'ve been a writer. It made me an outsider.\"\\n\\nAfter receiving his BA from Cornell University in industrial labor relations in 1971, Price told his parents he wanted to get an MFA in writing. \"They freaked out,\" he says. \"They said, \\'What are you going to do, drive a cab while you\\'re thinking of a poem?\\'\\u2009\" While working toward his MFA at Columbia University, he wrote furiously, and by the time he graduated in 1976, he\\'d published two novels.\\n\\nIn the early \\'80s, Price began writing screenplays to make extra money and developed a cocaine addiction that lasted several years. \"I\\'d write 100 great pages on coke, but they were for 100 different projects,\" he recalls. \"It was a low time.\" In 1984, he married his first wife, then got sober and had two daughters. The pair divorced in 2010, and, in 2012, Price married novelist Lorraine Adams, whom he calls his \"raw-hearted twin.\"\\n\\nAs Price\\'s screenwriting career kicked into gear in the late \\'80s, he hit the streets for inspiration. While writing the 1989 movie Sea of Love, he started going on ride-alongs with cops -- something he continued to do when he returned to novels in the \\'90s. \"I don\\'t want to write; I want to talk to people,\" Price says of doing field research for his projects. \"It\\'s my social life.\"\\n\\nDavid Simon, creator of The Wire, used Clockers as inspiration for his hit HBO series, for which Price became a writer. \"Clockers read like The Grapes of Wrath for the \\'80s cocaine epidemic,\" Simon says. \"Richard is a vacuum cleaner when it comes to any world he\\'s trying to create. If he\\'s writing about cops, they\\'re the realest cops you\\'ve ever heard talk. His milieu has often been crime, but he\\'s a literary writer. I was always a little enamored of him.\"\\n\\nPrice\\'s dialogue -- whether New York cop-speak or street slang -- is evocative and witty, while his artful explorations of human nature are windows into worlds beyond our own. Both are clearly on display in Lazarus Man. In the wake of the tenement collapse, the novel follows Anthony Carter, an unemployed former addict who\\'s pulled from the rubble and becomes a media sensation, all the while hiding a secret; Mary Roe, a cop obsessed with finding one of the missing residents; Felix Pearl, a mixed-race photographer searching for his \"true tribe\" in a gentrifying Harlem; and Royal Davis, a funeral parlor owner who hopes the collapse will generate business.\\n\\nAs the book unfolds, Price tenderly explores the emotional lives and romantic entanglements of his characters. Mary struggles to navigate a platonic relationship with her ex-husband while dating a man who wants more than she can give. Anthony falls for a woman from the neighborhood, exposing himself to rejection and pain.\\n\\nA real-life building collapse in 2014 near Price\\'s home sparked the idea for Lazarus Man, his first work set in Harlem. \"When that building fell, I felt it in my jawbone -- the boom, the vibrations -- and I was down there in half an hour, picking up this POV, that POV,\" Price says. \"If I\\'d written about Harlem the first year after I moved here it would\\'ve sounded like a Popeye travelogue. But after a while, when the amazing becomes normal, when your eyes and mind calm down, that\\'s when you pick up on nuances. Sometimes, you can go to the corner store for mint Milanos and come back with a chapter. It\\'s just living.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s these keen powers of observation that, according to Price\\'s editor, Jonathan Galassi, make him an artist. \"He\\'s very perceptive,\" Galassi says. \"He writes about the city from a vernacular point of view and knows it from the inside.\"\\n\\nAnd while Price is known for his gritty work, his agent, Lynn Nesbit, describes him as a one-of-a kind novelist with a gentle touch. \"For all the rough and tumble of his books, there\\'s a sensitivity to Richard that often doesn\\'t get mentioned,\" Nesbit says. \"He\\'s incomparable.\"\\n\\nThese days, Price is more content with life than ever. He recently became a grandfather, and despite those grumblings about wanting a magic writing pill, he\\'s having fun and growing as a writer. \"Nobody thinks about it, but fun is so important,\" he says. \"You never want to stop being a student, and I still have that eagerness to learn.\"', 'image': 'https://www.publishersweekly.com/images/data/ARTICLE_PHOTO/photo/000/114/114277-1.JPG', 'sentiment': 0.07450980392156858, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340395090', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:02:30Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-27T23:54:10Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/jensen-design-build-launches-inaugural-234900693.html', 'title': 'Jensen Design Build launches inaugural Homebuyers University in Mitchell', 'body': 'Sep. 27 -- MITCHELL -- Jensen Design Build is set to host the inaugural Homebuyers University on Tuesday, Oct. 1, at Bradley\\'s Pub and Grille in Mitchell. This educational event aims to demystify the complex process of home buying, offering a comprehensive overview for prospective buyers and builders.\\n\\nThe free, two-hour session will equip attendees with essential knowledge about the local real estate market and the intricacies of purchasing a home.\\n\\nJeremy Jensen, founder of Jensen Design Build, explained the motivation behind the event.\\n\\n\"We get asked some of the same questions on a daily basis by customers. We came up with Homebuyers University as a way to educate future potential homebuyers on what to expect throughout the home building process,\" Jensen said.\\n\\nThe event is designed for anyone interested in homeownership, whether they are first-time buyers or those considering custom-built homes.\\n\\nThe curriculum will cover various aspects of the homebuying journey. Attendees will gain insights into financing options, including understanding different mortgage types and programs available for various buyer situations. They will also learn about the step-by-step building procedure, providing a detailed look at what to expect during construction. Lot selection strategies will be discussed, helping participants choose the right location and land for their new home. Budgeting techniques will be covered to assist attendees in effectively managing their finances throughout the buying process.\\n\\nAdditionally, there will be discussions on the pros and cons of model/spec homes versus custom-built residences, giving insights into ready-to-move-in homes compared to personalized builds tailored to individual preferences.\\n\\nA key speaker at the event will be Cory Marek from Plains Commerce Bank, who will discuss financing options tailored for different buyer needs. He will highlight programs specifically designed for first-time homebuyers and veterans through Veterans Administration loans. Jensen noted that his business is one of only a few VA approved builders in the state.\\n\\nThe timing of this event is particularly significant given the current housing market dynamics.\\n\\nAccording to data from Zillow, the median home listing price in South Dakota has increased by approximately 26%, adjusted for inflation, from the second quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2024. This translates to an increase of about $75,000, with prices peaking at around $375,000 in February 2023. Despite these increases, Jensen believes that housing in South Dakota remains relatively affordable compared to national trends. The typical home price in the state is $308,851 -- 15% lower than the U.S. average -- which could be appealing for potential buyers looking for value.\\n\\nJensen feels the housing industry in South Dakota has always been strong.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve always been happy with the amount of building that\\'s been happening in South Dakota and in the area,\" he said.\\n\\nJensen acknowledges that the housing industry has faced some negative publicity in recent years, but attributes this to changing perceptions rather than a fundamental lack of affordability.\\n\\n\"Housing is affordable. It always has been affordable. But the perception of what I can afford is what has changed,\" Jensen explained.\\n\\nJensen believes that as prices and rates have increased, many people have had to reassess their needs and wants when it comes to housing.\\n\\nRecent trends suggest a potential stabilization in the housing market. Mortgage rates have declined from last year\\'s high of 7.79% to an average of about 6.22% for a 30-year fixed loan.\\n\\nJensen notes this shift has renewed interest among prospective buyers, and many individuals who previously delayed their home-buying decisions are now exploring their options again.\\n\\n\"Those who hesitated over the past few months are now reaching out to us,\" Jensen said.\\n\\nWhile the event is primarily focused on new construction home buyers, Jensen encourages all potential homebuyers to attend, regardless of their current stage in the home-buying process. The event will feature a roundtable format designed to foster interactive discussions among attendees.\\n\\n\"This is an inclusive event designed for everyone, from entry-level buyers to those looking at custom homes,\" Jensen said. \"The Homebuyers University is an opportunity to learn, ask questions, and connect with industry professionals who can guide you.\"\\n\\nJensen Design Build\\'s commitment extends beyond Mitchell to surrounding rural communities, including Corsica, Gregory, Parkston, Chamberlain, Huron and Howard. The company collaborates with local development groups to ensure access to affordable housing options in these areas.\\n\\nBy bringing new housing developments to smaller towns, they aim to make homeownership more attainable for residents outside urban centers.\\n\\n\"We want to help communities grow by providing quality housing that meets the needs of local residents,\" Jensen said.\\n\\nHe noted that their efforts are focused on understanding the unique challenges faced by these smaller towns and tailoring solutions that fit their specific circumstances.\\n\\nFor more information or to RSVP, interested parties can visit', 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png', 'sentiment': 0.2, 'relevance': 1}, {'id': '8340398935', 'is_duplicate': False, 'datetime_found': '2024-09-28T00:02:31Z', 'datetime_published': '2024-09-28T00:01:37Z', 'article_type': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://sanjosespotlight.com/election-2024-longtime-california-politico-sally-lieber-could-land-santa-clara-county-board-of-supervisors-district-5-seat/', 'title': 'Election 2024: Longtime politico could land Santa Clara County D5 seat - San Josรฉ Spotlight', 'body': 'Don\\'t miss a story.\\n\\nGet San Josรฉ Spotlight headlines delivered to your inbox.\\n\\nSally Lieber jumped into politics at age 13, rallying in Detroit for former Michigan state Sen. Doug Ross between delivering newspapers. She caught the political bug early, and since then has held numerous posts in California. This November she wants to add another achievement to her lengthy resume: Santa Clara County supervisor.\\n\\nLieber, 63, is competing against Mountain View Councilmember Margaret Abe-Koga for the open District 5 seat on the Board of Supervisors, with Supervisor Joe Simitian terming out this year. Lieber and Abe-Koga were the top vote getters advancing after the March primary election. District 5 includes Mountain View, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Palo Alto and a small section of San Jose.\\n\\nLieber expected more people with political experience to vie for the job, and when that didn\\'t happen she knew she had to run. If elected in November, her move from the California State Board of Equalization, a tax administration agency, to county supervisor couldn\\'t be more different. Lieber represents about 10 million state residents where she votes on tax issues. If elected supervisor, she would represent around 392,500 residents in one county and decide on local issues ranging from health care to jails.\\n\\nNo problem, she said. Lieber\\'s motto has always been: \"I can be dangerous anywhere.\"\\n\\n\"I may not win, but I am a master at (this). I\\'m a master policymaker and I\\'m a master campaigner,\" she told San Josรฉ Spotlight. \"I\\'m now so much stronger than I was in the past.\"\\n\\nLieber\\'s political career spans multiple stretches with the Mountain View City Council, getting her start as a Stanford University undergraduate student studying public policy. She also attended San Francisco City and Foothill colleges. After her first successful city council run where she served from 1998 to 2002, she was elected to the state Assembly from 2002 to 2008 and appointed Democratic speaker pro tempore from 2007 to 2008. She authored a bill to raise California\\'s minimum wage from $6.75 to $8 an hour over about two years -- a difficult endeavor under Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\n\\nLieber\\'s priorities for supervisor include homelessness and affordable housing, health care and mental health and affordable child care. She supports safe parking and sanctioned encampment sites for homeless residents, but said the county and its cities need to provide more permanent housing after people are placed in temporary housing sites.\\n\\nAs someone who has struggled with depression, she plans to examine the inpatient bed needs at mental health facilities and incentivize residents to use mental health services at hospitals. She aims to strengthen existing services and programs already funded rather than throwing money at new ones, using her past experience.\\n\\n\"It\\'s really exciting to me to look at the tie-in (between county and state),\" she said. \"Even though I\\'m out of the Legislature, I\\'ve continued to have bills, some signed by governors, so I think there\\'s a real crossover that\\'s powerful.\"\\n\\nLieber\\'s path to government was atypical. She moved to San Francisco from Michigan in her 20s to pursue opportunities in the building industry, her whole life packed in her car. She said she was often the only woman in the room. After moving to politics, she spent three years helping refugees in Greece from 2015 to 2018, traveling to and from the country.\\n\\nDespite Lieber\\'s unusual career, locals have paid attention to her.\\n\\nFormer Mountain View Mayor Lenny Siegel has endorsed and encouraged Lieber\\'s run for supervisor after nearly two decades of knowing her. He said Abe-Koga isn\\'t as supportive of housing justice as Lieber, who supported his referendum against restrictions on people living in RVs.\\n\\n\"We really need leaders who will step up and make the hard decisions,\" he told San Josรฉ Spotlight. \"Simitian did it and we need somebody to take his place who will continue to do it.\"\\n\\nCalifornia State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, San Jose Councilmembers Domingo Candelas and Peter Ortiz and the South Bay Progressive Alliance have also endorsed Lieber.\\n\\nPalo Alto resident Forest Peterson, a Stanford University civil and environmental engineering research affiliate, spends his weekends knocking on doors for Lieber. He said both candidates could be role models for his daughters as strong women in power, but he thinks Lieber is better for Stanford.\\n\\n\"She\\'s got the street cred, where she\\'s put shoes on the ground,\" he told San Josรฉ Spotlight.\\n\\nLieber said her career has been a long journey, which she hopes to continue as a supervisor.\\n\\n\"I just feel like for a little girl from Detroit who delivered that many newspapers before school and after school and everything, I\\'m doing pretty well,\" she told San Josรฉ Spotlight. \"I get to be in these great offices doing real things. It\\'s super exciting.\"', 'image': 'https://sanjosespotlight.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/23172405/381381449_10159789043147263_3775514300888880950_n-1200x630.jpg', 'sentiment': 0.03529411764705892, 'relevance': 1}]\n"
