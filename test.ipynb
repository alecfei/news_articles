It has filed for bankruptcy and renounced its status as a professional sports club. On Nov. 5, more than 80 people will lose their jobs in a 6 million euros ($6.5 million) redundancy plan. Without a new investor in sight one of France's proudest clubs faces a race against time to avoid liquidation.\\n\\n\\\"You feel so sad, disillusioned,\\\" said Alain Giresse, a club legend who scored 182 goals in 592 appearances in the 1970's and '80s. \\\"It's not a club that destroyed itself, it's a club that has been destroyed (by) the people in charge.\\\"\\n\\nThe team now plays in the National 2 league -- three rungs below France's top tier -- against opponents from towns with as few as 10,000 residents. By contrast, Bordeaux, a tourist destination world-renowned for its prestigious wines, counts about 1 million people in its metropolitan area.\\n\\nIf that's an unfamiliar situation for the club, the same can be said for its top player, former England and Liverpool striker Andy Carroll, who joined Bordeaux this summer.\\n\\n\\\"I knew the situation they were in and when I spoke to them, I knew there was a project there,\\\" Carroll, 35, told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \\\"It's a club that deserves to be at the top with the stadium, the training ground, the fans, everything that the club has to give.\\\"\\n\\nBordeaux's misfortune shows how a longtime top-level club can plummet through the league system of European soccer, which unlike U.S. professional sports operates on a system of promotion and relegation whereby teams at the bottom of a league drop down a level the following season.\\n\\nFounded in 1936, FC Girondins de Bordeaux has played a total of 75 seasons in France's top division and won its latest league title in 2009. It has also won four French cups, three League Cups and reached the 1996 UEFA Cup final.\\n\\nThe club's training ground is named after the 19th century Ch\\u00e2teau du Haillan, which sits at the heart of its sweeping meadows, befitting the aesthetic aura of a club graced by elegant playmakers like Giresse, Zidane and Yoann Gourcuff. In 2010, Haillan buzzed with anticipation when a Gourcuff-inspired Bordeaux reached the Champions League quarterfinals.\\n\\nNow almost every training pitch is empty.\\n\\n\\\"It's like a place that no is longer alive, there's nothing there,\\\" Giresse told AP by telephone.\\n\\nAfter the resolution of a dispute over matchday costs with the owners, Bordeaux has returned to the 42,000-capacity Matmut Atlantique stadium, which hosted soccer matches during the Paris Olympics. But the remote location, 40 minutes from the center by tram, adds to the impression of an isolated white elephant. During a league game on Oct. 19 against Avranches, a Normandy team, the food stalls were shut and fans sat on benches eating their own provisions like a surreal picnic.\\n\\nDenis Barbet, who has followed Bordeaux since the '80s, was deeply upset by the youth academy's closure.\\n\\n\\\"It's a catastrophe with all the people who lost their jobs,\\\" Barbet, 57, said. \\\"The training center is emblematic of the club, the Ch\\u00e2teau du Haillan is exceptional. When you've known that and the glory days, and now there's nothing left and everything's been abandoned, it's heart-breaking.\\\"\\n\\nHis son, Yoann Barbet, came through the academy and captained Bordeaux last season when it finished 12th in division two.\\n\\nAs another lifelong fan, Regis Marty used to watch Giresse and Zidane in the glory days and fears a bleak future.\\n\\n\\\"There are not many solutions other than a good buyer,\\\" Marty, 61, said. \\\"I don't believe it will happen. I want it with all my heart, but it will be difficult.\\\"\\n\\nDuring the game, the club's main supporter groups, Ultramarines and North Gate, expressed differing views about the club's leadership.\\n\\nWhile the Ultramarines unfurled a giant banner talking about \\\"renewed hope\\\" the North Gate urged club president G\\u00e9rard Lopez to \\\"get lost\\\" and let off flares with black smoke in protest.\\n\\nBordeaux won 1-0 with Carroll's fifth goal in three matches.\\n\\n\\\"Right now I'm running around out there every day feeling like I'm still 17,\\\" Carroll said. \\\"I feel really good in myself and in my life, in football and outside the club.\\\"\\n\\nCarroll's heading ability and remarkable chest-trapping of the ball set him apart in amateur soccer. Hardly surprising, considering he played 16 seasons in the Premier League and scored twice for England.\\n\\nCarroll cost Liverpool 35 million pounds ($46 million) when he joined from Newcastle in January 2011. Back then, he was the Premier League's most expensive British transfer signing.\\n\\nAfter years with injury problems, he joined French second-division team Amiens last season and moved to Bordeaux this year. His salary is undisclosed, but the maximum monthly wage in the amateur league is 3,500 euros ($3,800).\\n\\n\\\"When I first came here, I wanted to challenge myself, something different,\\\" Carroll said. \\\"I didn't know how it was going to be.\\\"\\n\\nHe has experienced deafening atmospheres at St. James' Park in Newcastle and Anfield in Liverpool. So what does he think about playing away against Saumur in a 2,500-capacity stadium?\\n\\n\\\"I love it, think it's brilliant. That's what grassroots football is about, that's where I started and it just brings back a lot of memories,\\\" Carroll said. \\\"It's just a great feeling just to play football and still have the fans there at my age. It doesn't matter if there's just a rope around the pitch or a big stadium.\\\"\\n\\nGeneral American Capital Partners bought Bordeaux from long-term owner M6 television channel in 2018, then sold it to backer King Street.\\n\\nThe pandemic and a collapsed television deal caused French soccer huge losses. When King Street pulled out, Lopez acquired Bordeaux in June 2021. The following season it finished last in Ligue 1 and was relegated.\\n\\nAs Bordeaux narrowly missed out on moving back up the next year, Lopez offset huge financial losses by writing a shareholder's loan to Bordeaux for 38 million euros.\\n\\nAhead of this season, the club failed to provide financial guarantees to French soccer's financial watchdog, the DNCG. After a deal with potential backers The Fenway Sports Group -- which owns Liverpool and the Boston Red Sox -- fell through, the DNCG demoted Bordeaux to the third tier in July. Bordeaux was placed into receivership by the city's commercial court, which triggered another relegation but at least meant a debt freeze.\\n\\nFifty academy players were released, generating short-term savings but depriving the club of future revenue from selling homegrown talent.\\n\\nFormer players like Giresse, Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, want Lopez out. So does city mayor Pierre Hurmic. Going into liquidation could enforce that, but Bordeaux would drop into the abyss of regional leagues.\\n\\nLopez didn't respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nBordeaux, at mid-table early in the season, needs two promotions to return to professional soccer so therefore plenty of goals from Carroll, who is optimistic despite the scale of the challenge.\\n\\n\\\"There's a massive pressure on us anyway, being who we are, to get promoted,\\\" Carroll said. \\\"If we can carry on winning games I think the pressure's going to be on the other teams to stop us.\\\"\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"hosted.ap.org\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"Associated Press\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"summary_large_image\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":0.06666666666666665, \"wgt\":467555115, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380484564\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:25:15\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:25:15Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:59Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/triblive.com\\/news\\/world\\/hungarys-orban-claims-polands-center-right-government-was-installed-by-the-eu\\/\", \"title\":\"Hungary's Orb\\u00e1n claims Poland's center-right government was installed by the EU\", \"body\":\"BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\\u00e1n suggested on Friday that Poland's government and its prime minister, Donald Tusk, were installed by the European Union as part of a plot to remove the country's previous right-wing populist leadership.\\n\\nOrb\\u00e1n provided no evidence to substantiate his claims about Poland's government, which was elected in 2023 with record high voter turnout of nearly 74%.\\n\\nThe comments came two days after Orb\\u00e1n, a nationalist who has taken an increasingly adversarial approach to the EU, told supporters in a speech that the bloc seeks to topple his government and install a puppet regime in Hungary.\\n\\nSpeaking to state radio Friday, Orb\\u00e1n lashed out at EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and the leader of the bloc's largest political group, European People's Party president Manfred Weber, claiming they were seeking to replace his government as he said they had in Poland in 2023, when a coalition led by Tusk defeated the governing Law and Justice party in national elections.\\n\\n\\\"It's not even a secret conspiracy against Hungary, it is an openly represented, announced plan,\\\" Orb\\u00e1n said of the alleged plot against him, for which he has not provided evidence. \\\"The same thing happened in Poland.

Poland's previous nationalist-conservative government also spent years wrangling with the EU over democratic deficiencies.\\n\\nIn response, Orb\\u00e1n has taken an increasingly combative approach to the bloc, which Hungary joined in 2004, and rallied euro-skeptic parties across the EU to create a far-right political force in the bloc's legislature. He has also moved Hungary closer to autocracies like Russia and China, seeking foreign investment and loans from Moscow and Beijing as EU funds dried up over his conduct.\\n\\nTusk's government has sought to restore Poland's democratic institutions that he sees as having been dismantled under the previous Orb\\u00e1n-allied government, but has maintained some conservative policies such as a tough stance on illegal immigration.\\n\\nOrb\\u00e1n, who faces national elections in early 2026, compared the EU to the former Soviet Union in the interview Friday.\\n\\n\\\"They're going to be working on this.

The victory makes it three wins out of three for Ange Postecoglou's side in Europe, with only Lazio and Anderlecht also possessing a 100% win rate.\\n\\nWhile Richarlison's penalty secured maximum points for the Premier League side, it was Moore who was subject to significant praise from Maddison. The England star - who was captain in the absence of Son Heung-min - delivered the ultimate compliment to his teenage team-mate by comparing a portion of his second half performance to one of the game's modern day greats.\\n\\n\\\"From minute 45 to 65 I thought we had Neymar on the left wing. He was brilliant. Just demanding the ball and fearless,\\\" he told TNT Sports. \\\"[He has] that young, fearless mentality and you never want to take that away from him.\\n\\n\\\"He's a young kid, a brilliant lad, a lovely boy. He takes in information, and he's got bags of ability, so I'll be there as an older player, hopefully with some wise words to help along the way. He's got all the ability. It's just about knuckling down and working hard, which he does to be fair to him.\\\"\\n\\nPostecoglou doubled down on the praise towards Moore, describing the youngster's progression as an exciting project for Spurs. \\\"[In the second half] we put Mikey on the left,\\\" the Aussie explained. \\\"I think he's more comfortable, as you saw, playing on the left-hand side.

water firm need emergency...\", \"body\":\"Thames Water has said it is seeking up to \\u00a33 billion in emergency loans in order to stay afloat until at least October next year.\\n\\nThe proposals would see the supplier borrow an initial \\u00a31.5 billion from its creditors, amid concerns the company could run out of cash early next year.\\n\\nIt will then seek another \\u00a31.5 billion depending on an upcoming decision by industry regulators.\\n\\nHere the PA news agency explains why the water company needs more money and what it could mean for customers.\\n\\n- What is Thames Water?\\n\\nThames Water is the UK's largest water supplier.\\n\\nThe utilities giant supplies around 16 million households across London and the South East.\\n\\nIt was formed after the privatisation of water and sewage businesses in the UK in 1989 by the Conservative government.\\n\\nThames Water supplies around 16 million households across London and the South East (Andrew Matthews\\/PA)\\n\\n- Who owns Thames Water?\\n\\nThames Water is owned by a group of investors, ranging from pensions funds to sovereign wealth funds.\\n\\nThe largest single owner is Canadian pension fund OMERS, which owns almost a third of the business.\\n\\nThe Universities Superannuation Scheme, a pension fund for UK academics, is the second-largest shareholder.\\n\\n- What are the company's finances like?\\n\\nThe company has come under greater scrutiny in recent years because of it heavy debt burden and the pressure of this on its operations.\\n\\nThames Water was left with around \\u00a310 billion in debt when it was sold by previous owner Macquarie in 2017.\\n\\nIt currently has around \\u00a315 billion in debt, which is expected to keep increasing thanks to high debt interest costs after a recent rise in borrowing costs.\\n\\nThe company swung back to a profit in its latest financial year but has been seeking longer-term funding in order to secure its finances.\\n\\n- Why has the business proposed a new funding deal?\\n\\nThames Water has eaten significantly into its cash position over the past year as it pays off its significant debt interest and investment commitments.\\n\\nOn Friday, the company said it had only \\u00a3500 million left, excluding another \\u00a3500 million set aside for reserves and compensation payments.\\n\\nIn July, the company said it had \\u00a31.8 billion of liquidity, which would be enough to tide it over until May next year.\\n\\nIt has now said it would need the extra \\u00a31.5 billion in funding to keep it operating until next October, with further cash needed to help it in the long run.\\n\\nThe group is also looking at separate equity options and a potential restructuring of debt.\\n\\n53%\\n\\nHow much Thames Water requested to raise bills by for the next five years\\n\\n- What does this mean for customers?\\n\\nThe company has called for significant price increases for its customers to help bring in more revenues and help it fund its turnaround plan.\\n\\nIt most recently asked water regulator Ofwat to allow it to hike prices by 53% for the next five years.\\n\\nOfwat said earlier this year it would allow average prices across water firms to be lifted by 23% over the period.\\n\\nThere have since been reports that Ofwat could allow for a sharper rise in its final decision after pressure from water firms and their investors.\\n\\nOfwat is expected to confirm its final decision on how much companies can increase their bills by December this year.\\n\\nThames Water has said it will need to access more of its potential \\u00a33 billion of funding if Ofwat does not allow it to hike prices as much as it hopes, although it would therefore be likely to launch an appeal to the regulator.\\n\\nEnvironment Secretary Steve Reed has ruled out bringing water companies back into public ownership (Peter Byrne\\/PA)\\n\\n- Is Thames Water heading for emergency nationalisation?\\n\\nIt has previously been reported that the Government has worked on a plan which could allow it to effectively nationalise the water giant.\\n\\nHowever, earlier this week the Environment Secretary said nationalising water firms would cost up to \\u00a3100 billion and \\\"not resolve the problems\\\" faced by customers.\\n\\nSteve Reed ruled out bringing the companies back into public ownership as he outlined an independent review into the industry following a public outcry over bills, bonuses and sewage pollution.\\n\\nThe independent review into the water industry could consider abolishing regulator Ofwat among potential measures to reform the sector.\\n\\n- What happens next for Thames?\\n\\nThames Water's next key steps will both begin in December.\\n\\nIn December it is expected to receive a final decision from Ofwat over how much it can increase customer bills for the next five years.\\n\\nThis will affect how much money the company will bring in and, therefore, how financially viable its current turnaround plans will be.\\n\\nIn December, it will also start the court proceedings in order to complete the initial \\u00a31.5 billion part of its funding plan. It hopes to complete this by January next year.\\n\\nThe company has said it will continue to supply customers and run services as normal for the meantime.\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"dailymail.co.uk\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"Daily Mail Online\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2024\\/10\\/25\\/12\\/wire-91280739-1729857445-770_636x382.jpg\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":0.0117647058823529, \"wgt\":467555107, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380484180\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:25:07\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:25:07Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:48Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/stupiddope.com\\/2024\\/10\\/sean-wotherspoon-and-fat-international-rev-up-fashion-with-limited-fatlanta-collection\\/\", \"title\":\"Sean Wotherspoon and FAT International Rev Up Fashion with Limited FATlanta Collection | stupidDOPE\", \"body\":\"Streetwear designer Sean Wotherspoon has teamed up once again with FAT International, delivering the highly anticipated FATlanta collection.

Benjamin Franklin. Betsy Ross. The two Founding Fathers and the seamstress of the American flag all once worshipped on the now centuries-old wooden pews of Christ Church.\\n\\nIt's the site of colonial America's break with the Church of England -- and where the U.S. Episcopal Church was born.\\n\\nLess than a mile south, past Independence Hall, Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church stands on the oldest parcel of land continuously owned by Black Americans. It's the mother church of the nation's first Black denomination.\\n\\nTwo churches, across the centuries. Generations after their birth in this nation first envisioned in Philadelphia, both churches continue to serve as the spiritual home for hundreds in the city.\\n\\nChurch members see the role of their congregation as crucial, a beacon ahead of a contentious presidential election in Pennsylvania -- the most pivotal of swing states. They also express concerns about political division that the Founding Fathers once feared could tear the nation apart.\\n\\n\\\"We've grown as a nation, but I think at this point, we're at a standstill. We're terribly divided,\\\" said Christ Church parishioner Jeanette Morris. A registered Republican, she previously voted for former President Donald Trump, but plans to back Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5 because of her support for reproductive rights. Morris is concerned about health issues following the repeal of Roe v. Wade.\\n\\n\\\"Nothing is getting done in Washington because nobody can agree on anything,\\\" she said after a recent service. \\\"I pray every Sunday that we can get past this all.\\\"\\n\\nToday's list of divisive issues is long: from abortion and immigration to taxes, climate change and the wars abroad. It's also the first presidential election since an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, an act of political violence steeped in the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.\\n\\n\\\"I think things have changed: Slavery is abolished. The Civil Rights Act was put in place. But still, deep down, the denizens of the United States haven't really come together,\\\" says Keith Matthews, 61, a Mother Bethel AME parishioner. \\\"There's still a lot of hatred and misunderstanding amongst the races.\\\"\\n\\nAt its infancy, the United States of America also was deeply divided. And some members of Christ Church -- from Washington to the parish rector -- seemed to be at the center of it all.\\n\\n\\\"What we're going through right now is certainly unprecedented politically. And there's a huge amount of potential instability and concern that a lot of people have in this church and the United States,\\\" says Zack Biro, executive director of the Christ Church Preservation Trust. \\\"And Christ Church is a perfect example of kind of weathering that storm.\\\"\\n\\nThe church was founded in 1695 by a group of Philadelphia colonists as the first parish of the Church of England in Pennsylvania. Congregants later included slaves and their owners, loyalists and patriots. They listened to sermons favoring and opposing independence.\\n\\nAnglican clergy loyal to the British king led weekly prayers for the monarch. But on July 4, 1776, Christ Church's vestry crossed out the king's name from the Book of Common Prayer -- a defiant act of potential treason. The book is preserved today in an underground museum, a testament to the church's revolutionary spirit on Independence Day.\\n\\n\\\"We tend to think that the early American republic was a time of great unity, but, like today, the political culture was deeply polarized,\\\" says John Fea, a professor of American history at Messiah University in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nDuring the 1780s, Fea said via email, debate raged about how to apply revolutionary-era principles such as liberty or freedom to all Americans. From the pulpit, the Rev. Jacob Duch\\u00e9, the church's rector, was seen as a moderate and led prayers as the first chaplain of the Continental Congress. But then he sided with the loyalists.\\n\\nWhen the British occupied Philadelphia in 1777, the rector wrote a letter to Washington urging him to surrender and reach a deal with the British. After the letter became public, Duch\\u00e9 traveled to England. Pennsylvania officials later labeled him a traitor and banned his reentry. His successor, the Rev. William White, became the first presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church. He's praised for keeping the unity of his congregation during times of turmoil.\\n\\nChrist Church's current senior pastor is the Rev. Samantha Vincent-Alexander, the first woman to serve as rector in its more than 300-year history.\\n\\n\\\"The idea of what do we do in this political environment right now and how do we deal with that is an incredible challenge,\\\" she says. \\\"Most of our congregations are not a unified voting bloc. They represent different people much like at the time of the American revolution.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We had people who were loyalists and people who supported independence, and the clergy at the time had to find a way to keep the congregation together.\\\"\\n\\nCongregants remain proud of Christ Church's crucial role in America's freedom. But they also grapple with contradictions. Some church members traded slaves and are buried in the church yard near signers of the Declaration of Independence. Franklin's tomb is in the nearby Christ Church burial ground.\\n\\n\\\"While we're very proud of our history, these people were not perfect. Sometimes we tend to think of them that way, but they weren't,\\\" says Harvey Bartle, a congregant for more than 30 years. \\\"What they were doing is trying to promote democracy. ... At least they advanced the ball beyond the divine right of kings, so that the society, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, could advance the system.\\\"\\n\\nOne church member, Absalom Jones, attended services while enslaved to a man serving in the church leadership. Jones bought his freedom and eventually became ordained as the first Black priest of the Episcopal Church. He also went on to co-create the Free African Society of Philadelphia, which Fea says \\\"sought to apply the rights secured from the American Revolution to the 2,000 or so free Black men and women living in the city at the time.\\\"\\n\\nMethodism was the fastest growing denomination in America in the 1790s. But some Methodist Episcopal Churches still segregated Black worshippers during services to the upstairs galleries. This prompted free Black Americans to start their own congregation.\\n\\nThe African Methodist Episcopal Church has been involved in the struggle for freedom and equality from its roots.\\n\\nIts founder, the Rev. Richard Allen, was born into slavery in Philadelphia in 1760 before buying his freedom in Delaware before he was 20. He returned to the city in the 1780s and became a minister.\\n\\nAfter white leaders at a Methodist church segregated Allen, Jones and other Black worshippers to the upstairs galleries for a prayer service, the group left the church and formed what would eventually become Mother Bethel AME. The church became a place of refuge for Black people fleeing slavery along the Underground Railroad and later a major gathering point for the Civil Rights Movement.\\n\\nBy creating Mother Bethel, Allen \\\"carved out a space where Black people could resist ... at a time where during slavery in the Deep South, Black people could not even congregate without the presence of a white man in between them,\\\" says Bethel AME's pastor, the Rev. Mark Tyler.\\n\\nToday, the AME Church has more than 2.5 million members and thousands of congregations in dozens of nations worldwide.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, we've made progress,\\\" says Tyler, citing Kamala Harris' campaign to become the country's first Black female president. But he also believes that much more needs to be done to bridge America's racial inequality and he worries about the potential of another Trump presidency. The AME Church, he says, has not \\\"outlived its usefulness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The fact that we have a person who openly embraces white supremacists, who has been president once and potentially could be president again in the 21st century, is all the evidence that you need to know that we still need places for Black people to come together and organize like the Black Church,\\\" he says.\\n\\nDuring a recent Sunday service, Tyler encouraged his congregation to vote. Some members later reflected on America's beginnings and its progress and shortcomings.\\n\\n\\\"Two things can be said at the same time: They were brilliant in the development of this nation. But they still carried slavery ideas, women were not allowed to vote, and that needed to be changed,\\\" parishioner Donna Matthews said about the Founding Fathers.\\n\\n\\\"Who are 'We the people'? I think people need to ask themselves that,\\\" said Matthews, 63, who attended the service with her husband, Keith, and their young grandson, Ezekiel. \\\"It's everyone. And it's the essence of why this church was started.\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of the service, parishioner Tayza Hill, 25, led groups on a tour of the church's museum. It preserves an original wooden pulpit used by the Rev. Allen and Black leaders including abolitionist Frederick Douglass and civil rights pioneer W.E.B. Du Bois when they addressed the congregation.\\n\\nHill says she has been hearing the same question in radio shows as the election approaches: \\\"Is the sun rising, or is the sun setting on democracy?\\\" She remains hopeful and believes the continuity of her church is vital.\\n\\n\\\"Seeing that there's still a building that has the history and is continuously being told is important because it's refusing to be erased from history,\\\" Hill says. \\\"As a nation and as a church, it's really up to us to defend the rights and the respectability of those who are withheld the full opportunity of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.\\\"\\n\\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

She also said HIV prevention had not been adequately integrated into national responses and remained underfunded.\\n\\n\\\"We are living in a world of multiple consecutive crises, which threaten the global HIV response. These include rising commodity prices, shifts in multilateralism, debt crises, poverty, and the worsening impacts of climate change,\\\" Ms Chikukwa said.\\n\\nShe said Lesotho was one of the few countries on track to controlling the HIV epidemic, having met the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets. However, she urged the country to focus on transforming its HIV response to ensure sustainability by 2030 and beyond. This, she said, required both political and financial commitment.\\n\\n\\\"The next phase of our HIV response demands that we refocus efforts on critical gaps in prevention, treatment, care, and support, particularly among specific sub-populations or geographic areas. This transformation should also ensure the integration of HIV responses into broader health and social systems while achieving more with fewer resources,\\\" she explained.\\n\\nShe added that it was essential to safeguard unique aspects of the response, including community-led initiatives and systems, and to address human rights and gender-related challenges.\\n\\nThe HIV and AIDS Program Manager at the Ministry of Health, Tapiwa Tarumbiswa, echoed these sentiments, outlining the ministry's vision for the future. He expressed hope that, in the future, HIV and TB epidemics will no longer be considered perpetual threats.\\n\\n\\\"We envision a future where all people in Lesotho have access to high-quality, universal HIV and TB prevention, treatment, and care services. These services should be primarily managed and sustained using domestic resources, whether in human resources, health information systems, supply chains, laboratories, quality assurance, or financing,\\\" Dr Tarumbiswa said.\\n\\nHe also outlined the three main goals aligned with the national strategic and health sector plans. The first goal is to reduce new infections, aiming for zero new HIV infections in Lesotho. However, by 2028, they realistically expect to see around 2600 new infections annually.\\n\\n\\\"As of the end of 2023, new infections were estimated at 4800,\\\" he added.\\n\\nAnother target is to reduce mother-to-child transmission to less than 2 percent by 2038. Additionally, they aim to reduce new annual HIV infections to be lower than the number of HIV-related deaths. \\\"As of the end of 2023, the HIV mortality rate stood at 5.1 percent.\\\"\\n\\nThe final goal is to increase knowledge of HIV status among people living with the virus. By 2028, they aim for 98 percent of people living with HIV to know their status and be linked to treatment to reduce the chances of transmitting the virus.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Lesotho People's Congress (LPC) Member of Parliament, Reverend Paul Masiu, commended Lesotho's progress in reaching global HIV targets, placing the country among the few to have achieved epidemic control. However, he emphasized that the country still faced significant challenges in tackling tuberculosis (TB).\\n\\n\\\"Lesotho remains one of the 30 countries with the highest TB and TB\\/HIV burden globally. While we are close to achieving the 95-95-95 targets for HIV epidemic control, disparities remain across demographics and sub-populations.

I am not an expert on Canadian law about open carrying so I will not be able to say that. But most likely they would have said that it was 'kirpan' which is a small blade whereas they had swords in their hand. They could come very, very close to me,\\\" said Verma.\\n\\nWhen asked if the incident was reported, Sanjay Verma said, \\\"It was all reported and we were told that investigations are on.\\\"\\n\\nSpeaking of intimidation from the Khalistanis, Sanjay Verma that the intimidation came through banned organisations associated with the Khalistani extremists.\\n\\n\\\"Some came through emails during the so-called protests, which I call hooliganism when they gathered in front of the two consulates or the High Commission. They would shout slogans to intimidate us. Whenever we were attending public events, again, they would shout slogans to intimidate us,\\\" he said.\\n\\nSharing an incident, Sanjay Verma said, \\\"In one instance, close to Diwali, they created 10 heads for me, called me Ravan.

Then what is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I reported this to the foreign ministry. The response was that we forwarded it to the relevant authorities, which is correct. We also do the same.

Not to come out,\\\" he stated.\\n\\nWhen asked if he at any point in time he felt threatened physically?\\n\\nSanjay Verma replied, \\\" Threatened, yes. But did I become threatened? No. In most of my public events, there will be these hooligans outside shouting slogans against India, but also against me. Some of them are very burly-looking tall guys who would also gesture to physically harm me, but just the gestures, except for a few incidents. And so they tried.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They came close to me. They tried to intimidate me through such, slogans shouting, and abusing me verbally.

They were very professional, well-trained, and very respectful. So as far as the police officers who were protecting us and now protecting my colleagues there, very, very professional, never had an iota of doubt on their professionalism.\\\"\\n\\nAdding further he said, \\\"But unfortunately, the statement which we saw in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police press briefing, where even the investigation has not been concluded, that was a sad thing to see.\\\"\\n\\nHigh Commissioner Verma said that he was there to serve India's national interest and was committed to doing so.\\n\\n\\\"So diplomacy for most of us would be, you know, being nice, nice cities.

Many just want to sabotage our exceptionalism, and fundamentally transform us -- into The Americas first, then the United Nations. Not only politically and economically, but also culturally.\\n\\nTrump's plans to mass deport the illegal aliens will help salvage American values, but, in the meantime, our society's preferences have already been transformed. A few of our favorite things are distinctly un-American.\\n\\nAmericans adore our pets, and dogs are the most popular. Representing a radical transformation of preferences, Chihuahuas are now ranked number one.\\n\\nChihuahuas?! That's less of a dog than a poodle, for heaven's sake. Invoking Plato's Forms (abstract things and concepts that most accurately represent reality) as the benchmark, Chihuahuas would barely qualify under the Form of dog-ness. They are absent from the local dog-walking group, for example. In fact, they are nowhere to be seen at the local dog park, but somehow these lapdogs have become the most popular breed in America. We are really in decline.\\n\\nUntil recently, proper dogs like Labradors were perennially the most popular breed, per the American Kennel Club. Other favored breeds include real dogs like Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, and Bulldogs. Poodles also usually make the top 10, but that's probably because 68% of females own dogs (compared to 80% of men), and poodles sport quite a feminine disposition.\\n\\nChihuahuas are fine, I suppose, having basic traits that humans favor, such as loyalty. The best thing about a Chihuahua is that it is not a Shih-Tzu, still, they are rather unaesthetic and yappy. Unsurprisingly, they are particularly prevalent in the West, including New Mexico.\\n\\nWhich leads to considerations of other trends that may be influenced by old Mexico. In some staples, the popularity of products from one of our biggest trading partners now surpass good ole American stalwarts.\\n\\nOdds are that if someone allows a Chihuahua to domicile with them, their favorite beer is Modelo, another import from Mexico. Indeed, Modelo Especial has recently risen to America's favorite beer. Sure, Bud's demise was hastened after their misguided embrace of fringe sub-cultures, but what about Coors or Miller as an all-American replacement?\\n\\nFor those preferring to imbibe the hard stuff, one might consider whiskey, a good American bourbon or Tennessee brand, or perhaps a martini (shaken or stirred). Think again... Tequila is now the best-selling spirit in America. Authentic tequila is made in Mexico, mostly the state of Jalisco. President Trump has proposed a tariff on it.\\n\\nBetter not drink on an empty stomach, though, so perhaps a nice sandwich will hit the spot? Actually, tortilla sales have surpassed white sandwich bread as the first choice for enveloping tasty treats.\\n\\nFrom our beloved pets to our selected drinks and gastronomic desires, some of America's favorites -- the things that bring simple, everyday pleasure and contentment -- have been supplanted commensurate with invasions across our porous border. In these important cultural elements, we are gradually becoming The Americas.\\n\\nAs Lady Liberty projects her welcome to the world's downtrodden masses, we remain a generous and compassionate people to those who wish to assimilate legally. Nevertheless, Trump better resume his presidency (with loyal advisors) and start mass deportations -- of the criminal illegal aliens -- before we devolve into a nebulous country mirroring the United Nations. Some of their favorite things are rather repulsive.\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"americanthinker.com\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"American Thinker\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"https:\\/\\/images.americanthinker.com\\/ps\\/pss9mcoax8vz2wnrhim5_800.jpg\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":0.07450980392156858, \"wgt\":467555103, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380484115\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:25:03\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:25:03Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:43Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mercurynews.com\\/2024\\/10\\/25\\/dodgers-will-wear-patch-honoring-fernando-valenzuela-in-world-series\\/\", \"title\":\"Dodgers will wear patch honoring Fernando Valenzuela in World Series and 2025\", \"body\":\"LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers will wear a patch on their uniforms honoring Fernando Valenzuela during the World Series.\\n\\nValenzuela died this week at age 63.

Sub-Saharan African nations that depend on commodity exports need to reform their economies to tackle patchy regional economic growth, International Monetary Fund Africa Director Abebe Aemro Selassie said.\\n\\nThe region is expected to grow by 3.6% this year, unchanged from last year and down from an April forecast of 3.8%, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook released this week, with commodity economies lagging their diversified counterparts.\\n\\nThe commodity intensive countries are growing at about half the rate of the rest of the region, the IMF said in the report, with oil exporters struggling the most in what it described as \\\"subdued and uneven\\\" regional growth.\\n\\n\\\"South Sudan, Nigeria, Angola are all very much in that camp,\\\" Abebe told Reuters.\\n\\nWhile diversified economies such as Senegal and Tanzania are expected to grow at above the regional average, Nigeria will fall short, growing at 2.9%, according to the IMF's regional economic outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa launched on Friday.\\n\\n\\\"They have had very large macroeconomic imbalances, financing challenges which have held back growth,\\\" Abebe said.\\n\\nHe said the government in Nigeria needed to \\\"squarely address\\\" those challenges, since they had caused high inflation and put pressure on the cost of living.\\n\\nPresident Bola Tinubu's government has launched a series of reforms it says are aimed at lifting economic growth and attracting investment.\\n\\nSouth Africa, whose growth has been curbed by crippling electricity blackouts, is expected to grow by 1.1% this year, the IMF said.\\n\\nArmed conflicts are also weighing on growth, the IMF said, citing South Sudan's oil exports blocked by conflict in neighbouring Sudan, which hosts the crude export pipeline.\\n\\n\\\"They (oil exporters) need to find new sources of growth, get more private sector investment - so working on reforms that will facilitate that is important,\\\" Abebe said.\\n\\nOther challenges facing African oil producers include the global transition to green fuels due to climate change, the report said.\\n\\nSMALL REBOUND\\n\\nSub-Saharan Africa's economic growth is expected to improve slightly next year to 4.2%, the IMF report said.\\n\\nThe report found that nearly half of the 20 fastest growing economies in the world this year were in Sub-Saharan Africa, but cautioned that faster growth rates were required to reduce widespread poverty and inequalities.\\n\\nOne of the main obstacles to faster growth include a lack of access to affordable financing, the IMF said, as countries struggle with heavy debt loads and high debt servicing costs.\\n\\nWhile some countries have been able to sell bonds on international capital markets this year following a two-year hiatus caused by geopolitical shocks and elevated interest rates in advanced economies such as the United States, the new funding came at a high cost.\\n\\n\\\"The old development finance architecture is not delivering, and, if anything, kind of is in the process of disintegrating,\\\" Abebe said, citing \\\"very problematic levels\\\" of official bilateral funding for poor countries.\\n\\nFor countries such as Kenya, where deadly anti-tax hikes protests in June forced the government to withdraw its finance bill for this fiscal year, such development assistance from overseas has been falling in recent years, a senior U.N. official told Reuters.\\n\\nThe solutions lay in ensuring that poor nations continue to access low-priced development financing from bilateral and multilateral lenders, Abebe said.\\n\\n\\\"We need also to find ways in which when countries are facing liquidity rather than solvency challenges, more financing can be made available for them to support reforms so they can move on to better times,\\\" he said.\\n\\n(Reporting by Duncan Miriri and Karin Strohecker; Graphics by Sumanta Sen; Editing by Alison Williams)\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"dailymail.co.uk\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"Daily Mail Online\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":null, \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":-0.05882352941176472, \"wgt\":467555102, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380484196\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:25:02\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:25:02Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:49Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/allafrica.com\\/stories\\/202410250316.html\", \"title\":\"Somalia: Turkish Vessel Oruc Reis Docks At Mogadishu Port Ahead of Oil and Gas Exploration Off Somalia's Coast\", \"body\":\"Ankara, Turkey -- In a move to bolster its energy security and assert its maritime exploration capabilities, T\\u00fcrkiye's state-of-the-art seismic research vessel, Oruc Reis, has embarked on a significant mission to explore the seabed off Somalia for potential oil and natural gas deposits.\\n\\nThe announcement was made by Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar on Friday, marking a pivotal moment in the country's international energy strategy.\\n\\nBayraktar took to X to confirm the vessel's arrival, posting, \\\"Oruc Reis has reached its mission location after its journey across continents.\\\" This voyage not only represents T\\u00fcrkiye's commitment to expanding its energy portfolio but also highlights its capability to conduct advanced seismic surveys in regions far from its own coasts.\\n\\nThe deployment of Oruc Reis underscores T\\u00fcrkiye's ambition to tap into new hydrocarbon resources as part of a broader geopolitical strategy.

Why Shell's Divestment from the Niger Delta Must not Harm Human Rights\\\", held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\\n\\nDummett told the government that it must ensure that the divestment does not limit Shell's liabilities without a full investigation into and remediation of all existing pollution, the maintenance and repair of existing pipelines, and the protection of pipelines from sabotage.He said: \\\"Amnesty International has documented grievous and enduring human rights abuses resulting from oil contamination in the area, where Shell has operated since the 1950s. Amnesty International is concerned that the proposed sale will deny people already harmed access to adequate remedy, and potentially expose many more to future abuses.\\\"\\n\\nThe report recommends a series of safeguards and action to help protect the rights of people potentially affected by Shell's planned disposal of its onshore oil interest in the Niger Delta, reportedly for about US$3billion.\\n\\nSpeaking further, Dummett noted that \\\"For decades spills have damaged the health and livelihoods of many of the Niger Delta's inhabitants .\\\"\\n\\nAccording to him, \\\"Shell should not be allowed to wash its hands of the problems and leave. Shell has earned billions of dollars from this business and it must make sure that its withdrawal does not have negative human rights and environmental consequences.\\\"\\n\\nThe report also stated that \\\"The government should consider requiring Shell to act as guarantor to ensure any purchaser is capable of making good and remediating damage caused by any future spills and that any buyer is committed to transparency, environmental compliance, consultations with communities, and limiting greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\n\\\"By exercising appropriate oversight to Shell's sale, Nigeria's incoming administration has a unique opportunity to demonstrate its determination to upload and protect the human rights of its citizens, including their rights to an adequate standard of living, clean water, and health. We are also calling for effective remedy for people whose rights have long been abused.\\\"\\n\\nObserving that \\\"Shell is not uniquely responsible for the devastating oil pollution that blight the Niger Delta,\\\" Dummett said other actors in the devastation include, federal and state authorities, adding that \\\"They too have the obligation to ensure that Shell's divestment does not lead to further human rights harm. \\\"\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"allafrica.com\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"allAfrica\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn08.allafrica.com\\/static\\/images\\/structure\\/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":-0.05098039215686279, \"wgt\":467555101, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380484095\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:25:01\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:25:01Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:42Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/jerseyeveningpost.com\\/morenews\\/uknews\\/2024\\/10\\/25\\/residents-at-care-home-where-three-people-died-felt-safe-according-to-report\\/\", \"title\":\"Residents at care home where three people died 'felt safe', according to report\", \"body\":\"Family members and residents of a care home where three people died of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning previously told inspectors that the staff were \\\"very safety conscious\\\", according to reports by the healthcare watchdog.\\n\\nDorset Police received a report at 7:16am on Wednesday regarding three residents - two men, aged 74 and 91, and an 86-year-old woman - who were found dead at Gainsborough Care Home in Ulwell Road, Swanage.\\n\\nSeven people were taken to hospital as a precaution and were not in a serious condition, the force has said.\\n\\nThe deaths are being treated as unexplained and detectives are still exploring possible carbon monoxide poisoning as the primary line of inquiry.

A 32-year-old woman named Alexandra Pennig had been found dead in her bathroom with a single gunshot wound to the head.\\n\\nFor the detectives, what really happened to Pennig is something that still haunts them to this day. And it's the question at the center of \\\"The Strange Shooting of Alex Pennig,\\\" reported by \\\"48 Hours\\\" contributor Natalie Morales airing Saturday, Oct. 26 at 10\\/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.\\n\\nWhen detectives DeSanto and O'Donnell arrived at the apartment, they found out Pennig had not been alone at the time of her death. A man named Matthew Ecker was also there. Ecker and Pennig were both nurses and had met two years earlier when they worked at the same clinic. Ecker told first responders the gun was his, and that Pennig had grabbed it, locked herself in the bathroom, and then fired the shot. \\\"I thought everything was fine,\\\" he said. \\\"And then she just grabbed the gun.\\\" Ecker told first responders that after he heard the shot he immediately broke open the bathroom door: \\\"I tried to do what I could. And then I washed my hands ... That's why I don't have anything on my hands.\\\" Ecker said he then called 911. But it was too late. He said he didn't know why Pennig would do this.\\n\\nIn Pennig's apartment, there was alcohol and six bottles of prescription medication, including antidepressants, all prescribed to Pennig. For the detectives, it suggested Alex might have been depressed, and they wondered if Ecker's story that she took her own life was true.\\n\\nBut they also noticed something that seemed to contradict Ecker's story. He had said he washed his hands in the bathroom sink before calling 911, but DeSanto recalled the first responders told her the sink was dry. \\\"The sink was dry. If he had said, you know, he called the police right away, that sink probably would've been still wet,\\\" DeSanto explained, \\\"but it was very dry in there.\\\"\\n\\nWhen O'Donnell looked into Pennig's background, she learned from Alex's parents that Alex had struggled in the past with depression and addiction. \\\"I had asked, um, if she had been suicidal in the past, um, and dad said, she had, um, tried, uh, to overdose before,\\\" said O'Donnell. According to Alex's father, Jim Pennig, several years prior, Alex had taken a handful of pills \\\"and then had told her mom that she was attempting suicide.\\\" After that, Alex's parents told the detectives they sent her to rehab, and she eventually got clean. Despite her past struggles, Alex's parents told O'Donnell they had just seen her at Thanksgiving. And her mom, Mary Jo Pennig, had just talked to her that evening. \\\"She was doing well,\\\" she said. For them, the idea that their daughter had died by suicide did not make sense. \\\"Knowing your kid, it didn't fit,\\\" Mary Jo Pennig said.\\n\\nSince Ecker was the last person to see Alex Pennig alive, the detectives zeroed in on him. \\\"He's the only one that can tell us what happened. He was the only one that was there,\\\" said O'Donnell. They questioned Ecker about what had happened that night. He said he and Alex Pennig had gone out to several local bars, and when they arrived back at her place, everything was fine: \\\"We were laughing on the way home,\\\" said Ecker. DeSanto asked him if, once they got into the apartment, they had gotten into a fight. Ecker said they did not.\\n\\nDET. ABBY DESANTO: You guys weren't arguing or anything?\\n\\nMATTHEW ECKER: No.\\n\\nDET. ABBY DESANTO: There's no fight with you two?\\n\\nMATTHEW ECKER: Not between us.\\n\\nFor hours, Ecker continued to say Pennig had locked herself in the bathroom, fired the shot and then he broke open the door to try and help her: \\\"That gun went off behind a closed door ... I did not shoot her.\\\"\\n\\nBut the detectives had their doubts. Then they got a call from the forensic unit that was still processing the scene. And according to O'Donnell, what they found changed everything. \\\"Once Alex was moved, they found underneath where Alex had been laying was a round metal piece,\\\" she said. \\\"It was the shape of a ring, and about the size of a quarter.\\\" O'Donnell said it was part of the lock from the bathroom door, and the fact that it had been discovered under Pennig was key. \\\"For us, it meant that the door was forced open before she was shot.\\\"\\n\\nThe detectives felt the discovery of the metal ring proved Ecker had lied and had not broken the door open after he heard the shot. The detectives suspected Pennig and Ecker had argued and that she had locked the bathroom door to get away from him. Then Ecker broke open the door, the metal part broke off and fell to the ground, and then he shot Pennig and she landed on top of it.\\n\\nEcker was charged with second-degree murder. In February 2024 he was convicted and later sentenced to 30 years. He is appealing his conviction.\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"dnyuz.com\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"DNyuz\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"https:\\/\\/dnyuz.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/10\\/How-a-small-piece-of-a-bathroom-door-lock-helped.jpg\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":-0.2941176470588235, \"wgt\":467555075, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380483383\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":true, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:24:34\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:34Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:13Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.waterford-news.ie\\/poll-are-you-fed-up-of-the-clocks-going-back_arid-36074.html\", \"title\":\"Poll: Are you fed up of the clocks going back? - Homepage - Waterford News & Star\", \"body\":\"With the looming eventuality of the clocks going back on Sunday, resistance to the practice has resurfaced.\\n\\nEvery year the clocks go back an hour at 2am on the last Sunday of October, seeing Ireland's time zone switch from Irish Summer Time to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).\\n\\nSe\\u00e1n Kelly, Fine Gael MEP for Ireland South, said the clock changes are an \\\"outdated practice\\\" that have negative effects on health, well-being, and safety.\\n\\nSo, if you had your way, would the clock changes stay or go?

United's defensive porousness means Onana has been kept far busier than he would like since his arrival at the club. No goalkeeper has faced more shots in the last two Premier League seasons. But his saves have often kept their heads above water.\\n\\nAccording to Opta's expected goal model, Onana is third among goalkeepers, behind only Arijanet Muric and Emiliano Martinez, for expected goals prevented since the start of last term, his saves worth a whopping 7.14 goals, based on the quality of chances faced.\\n\\nOf course, it is his errors, mostly concentrated in his first few months at the club, which stick in the memory. Perceptions were shaped early among Premier League viewers. But his value has become clear to United fans and a broader reassessment is probably overdue.\\n\\nThere were of course costly mistakes in the Champions League last year. In the Premier League, though, Onana has only made two errors leading to shots in 46 games, according to Opta. It is half as many as Alisson and three fewer than Martinez since the start of last season.\\n\\nHis occasional mis-steps continue to be pounced upon by critics. But his heroics on Thursday night were just the latest reminder that United would be worse off without him.\\n\\nArsenal's injury issues, coupled with unconvincing displays against Bournemouth and Shakhtar Donetsk, have added to the clamour for teenager Ethan Nwaneri to be given more chances. Mikel Arteta's perceived reluctance has prompted criticism from some fans.\\n\\nWatching his cameos this season, it is easy to understand the desire to see more of him. Nwaneri, characterised by driving runs and smooth footwork, is clearly a thrilling prospect. Inside the club, he is seen as having the humility and work ethic to match his talent.\\n\\nCould Arteta have made more use of him against Bournemouth and Shakhtar? Probably. Arsenal looked clunky at the Vitality Stadium even before William Saliba's red card. Nwaneri is probably the closest thing Arteta has in his squad to a Martin Odegaard alternative.\\n\\nBut it still feels harsh to criticise the manager who made him the youngest player in Premier League history, aged 15 years and 181 against Brentford in 2022, over a lack of opportunity.\\n\\nArteta said that historic appearance at the Gtech Community Stadium was motivated by \\\"gut instinct\\\" at the time. In truth, it was more calculated than he let on; an attempt to show the club's most prodigiously talented academy player a pathway to the first-team.\\n\\nInevitably, though, it also thrust him into the consciousness of supporters who, two years on, have only seen him make a further five competitive appearances at senior level.\\n\\nIt may not feel like much but it is important to remember Nwaneri only became old enough to sign a professional contract in March and is still five months from his 18th birthday. He is the second-youngest of 440 players to have played in the Premier League this season.\\n\\nIt is worth noting, too, that Nwaneri is ahead of others of comparative potential. His total of five Premier League appearances already matches that of Manchester City's Phil Foden at 18. Bukayo Saka, his fellow Arsenal academy graduate, did not reach the same milestone until a month after turning 18.\\n\\nThere is, perhaps, a broader question to be asked about Arteta's use of academy players. Saka is the only one who makes their strongest team now. But that scarcity is a natural consequence of rising standards. Arsenal have gone from top-four hopefuls to title challengers under his management.\\n\\nIt is a testament to Nwaneri's ability that he already looks capable of stepping up. But over-exposure at such a young age brings risks. And besides, at 17, it is more accurate to say he is ahead of schedule than being held back by his manager. His time will come.\\n\\nAlexander Isak's 21 Premier League goals last season put him behind only Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer but he goes into Newcastle's meeting with Chelsea, live on Sky Sports on Sunday, having only found the net once in six games. He does not look himself.\\n\\nThe 25-year-old has been hindered by a broken toe, admittedly, missing three games before Saturday's 1-0 loss to Brighton. But his one-on-one effort saved by Bart Verbruggen, one of seven shots without scoring in the game, seemed to sum up his recent struggles.\\n\\nIn total, it is one goal from 18 shots this season. A conversion rate which stood at 27 per cent last season, and 20 per cent the year before that, has fallen to only six per cent this term.\\n\\nIt should be noted, however, that, according to Opta's expected goals model, that one-on-one chance against Brighton was one of only two high-value opportunities he has had all season.\\n\\nHe converted the other, from Jacob Murphy's pass across goal to clinch the 2-1 win over Tottenham in September. Otherwise, though, he has been limited to low-quality chances, his average of 0.42 non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes down from 0.62 last season.\\n\\nIt is of course partly the responsibility of a striker to generate scoring chances. Isak has so far lacked his usual sharpness. But the responsibility for his scoring struggles should be shared. Better service is needed to return to the heights of last season.\\n\\nEverton's Iliman Ndiaye has been fun to watch this season.

The result isn't just an epic fantasy show with a grand scope, but one that homes in on the intimate personal stakes.\\n\\n[Ed. note: This review contains spoilers for The Legend of Vox Machina season 3.]\\n\\nThe third season of The Legend of Vox Machina picks up right where the last one left off: Raishan (Cree Summer), one of the dragons in the group bent on taking over the world, reaches out to the adventuring party and offers them intel on a magical item that could stop the tyrannical dragon leader.\\n\\nBut, predictably, the adventurers of Vox Machina have a lot going on in this season, and not just when it comes to defeating the big bad dragon. Bard Scanlan (Sam Riegel), for instance, wishes to repair the relationship he has with his estranged daughter. Druid Keyleth (Marisha Ray) and rogue Vax (Liam O'Brien) dance around a romantic relationship while facing their own internal battles, as do Vex (Laura Bailey) and Percy (Taliesin Jaffe). Pike (Ashley Johnson) grapples with her faith, and barbarian Grog (Travis Willingham)... well, Grog's actually pretty peachy this season. There's world and lore to expand and minor character backstories to flesh out, and still, even with all of that in 12 half-hour episodes, the show doesn't actually feel like it's taking on too much.\\n\\nIt's because the creators know when to slow down. Improvised banter is built into the original campaign, but it proves to be a valuable asset in figuring out when to let the emotional beats sit for a moment. The characters may be facing increasing stakes and bigger foes, but they're also feeling the effects of those things.\\n\\nFor the audience, this is incredibly valuable. These days, a lot of high-stakes shows don't bother to really drill in on the downtime or the moments between big world-ending plot points. Eight hour-long episodes go by in a breathless blur. But The Legend of Vox Machina checks in with the characters, how they're feeling about themselves, their mission, and each other. Even with everything happening, they're not on all the time. There's a whole bit where they take a moment to rest and recover in Scanlan's fabulous dream mansion, for instance, and it's a chance for them to hit pause and reflect. And some of the best decisions the creative team makes are in integrating more of these moments that weren't in the original campaign.\\n\\nCase in point: Percy's death. In the tabletop session, he was dead for a bit, but quickly revived. And for a D&D game with friends, that makes sense, since you want to keep the game going. But for a television show, having an easy resurrection would turn a big consequential moment into just a handwave. Dr. Anna Ripley (Kelly Hu) would be easy to dismiss as a threat, and there wouldn't be a chance for the rest of the characters to reflect. Ultimately, Percy does come back (in a different way, with new ramifications), but turning it into a few-episode-long arc really just emphasizes the personal stakes in a way that this show does very well.\\n\\nThe writers and directors have a daunting task with this show: Adapt hours and hours (and hours) of actual play into 12 half-hour episodes. The fact that they've so smartly zeroed in on what's important to the characters and the story is impressive, as is the fact that they know when to change those beats and make them fit within the structure of television. Letting Percy's death sit longer allows for the other characters -- particularly Vex -- to really reexamine their own priorities, while also heightening the fact that characters can and will die if they don't defeat the big bad.\\n\\nIt's not that The Legend of Vox Machina has more episodes or run time to fill these emotional beats in than other fantasy shows; it's that the creators know to give them just as much weight as the epic battles and big villain showdowns. The action sequences are certainly fun and intense, but they're not dragged on or given more precedence than quiet moments watching a sunrise. The allure of Critical Role has always been the characters (and the actors behind them), and that focus on the small stakes as well as the large ones is what levels up The Legend of Vox Machina. And in the third season, when so much is happening, yet there's still space for that muchness to breathe, it's more evident than ever that this show is something special.\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"dnyuz.com\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"DNyuz\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"https:\\/\\/dnyuz.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/10\\/In-a-world-without-filler-episodes-The-Legend-of-Vox.jpg\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":0.192156862745098, \"wgt\":467555074, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380482641\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:24:33\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:33Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:23:36Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.dailymail.co.uk\\/health\\/article-14001391\\/Davina-McCall-menopause-HRT-hack.html\", \"title\":\"Davina McCall's menopause GP reveals genius hack to reduce HRT risk\", \"body\":\"Davina McCall's menopause doctor has revealed a surprising hack that tackles a little-known risk of using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) drugs.\\n\\nDr Naomi Potter, who co-wrote the 2022 book 'Menopausing' with Ms McCall, shared the tip on how to stop the hands becoming contaminated gel forms of the medicine.\\n\\nIn a video on Instagram Dr Potter, who is a British Menopause Society specialist, describes 'a hands-free' method of applying oestrogen gel, which she says is 'the best way'.\\n\\nHRT, which mimics the hormones that drop naturally in a woman's body as a consequence of the menopause, is used by almost two million women in the UK.\\n\\nGels contain the female hormone oestrogen which is absorbed through the skin, typically applied to the arms, thighs, abdomen or buttocks.\\n\\nBut after applying it, traces of the gel may remain to the hands which can then be transferred to a partner or child, or even a pet, when a woman touches them.\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\nA post shared by Dr Naomi Potter | Menopause Doctor (@dr_naomipotter)\\n\\nDr Naomi Potter (right), a British Menopause Society accredited hormone specialist who has worked with celebrities like Davina McCall (left)on menopause awareness, shared a trick on how to stop your hands becoming contaminated with HRT drugs\\n\\nFor this reason, women who use the gel are advised to wash their hands thoroughly after applying the drug.\\n\\nWhile the risk is extremely small, exposing children and men to excess oestrogen could theoretically trigger problems, such as excess breast tissue growth.\\n\\nDr Potter shared the neat hack she says he learned from her own patients on how to avoid this risk entirely.\\n\\n'Most commonly women push the pump dispenser down onto their hand and rub it in,' she said in the clip which has been viewed more than 50,000 times.\\n\\nRead More Fury at viral food guru Eddie Abbew for claiming perimenopause is 'BS' and can be reversed with diet\\n\\nHowever, Dr Potter added: 'One way you can avoid the contamination on your hand is simply by using the top of the Oestrogel [brand of gel] bottle.'\\n\\n'You put your dispense dose down on the top of the bottle and then you can apply it.\\n\\n'Then let it dry, and your hands are left completely uncontaminated by the additional oestrogen.'\\n\\nHRT can come in tablets, patches, gels and sprays and several high-profile celebrities, including Penny Lancaster and Ms McCall have spoken about how the drugs have transformed their lives.\\n\\nAccording to the NHS, the risk of developing serious side-effects on HRT are 'very low', although it can lead to a small increase in breast cancer risk.\\n\\nMenopause occurs when a woman stops having periods and is no longer able to get pregnant naturally.\\n\\nIt is a normal part of ageing and is marked by levels of the sex hormone oestrogen dropping.\\n\\nIt typically starts between the age of 45 and 55 for most women.\\n\\nHowever, it can occur earlier, naturally for a minority of women, and as a result of other health problems and treatments, like those for cancer.\\n\\nSome women go through this time with few, if any, symptoms.

The film, directed by Shashanka Chaturvedi, has been one of the most anticipated OTT releases of the year. Kriti, in a bold dual-role performance as twin sisters Shailee and Saumya, impressed viewers with her skill at portraying contrasting personalities. Shaheer Sheikh also received praise for his role, while Kajol brought her signature intensity to the screen. However, despite the film's star power, it seems to be struggling to resonate due to a weak screenplay and a storyline that left fans wanting more.\\n\\nDo Patti follows the story of twin sisters, Shailee and Saumya, who find themselves entangled in a web of suspense and unexpected revelations. The thriller promises an intense exploration of familial bonds against a backdrop of mounting tension and hidden truths.\\n\\nWhile Kriti's fans flooded social media with praise for her dual role execution, feedback about the overall movie has been less forgiving. Twitter users, for instance, have voiced concerns about the storytelling, citing issues with direction and depth of characters. One viewer remarked, \\\"#DoPatti is as flat as it can get. Kajol, Kriti, and Shaheer are sincere in their roles, but the fault lies with the writing and direction. The characters lack depth and are so unconvincing.\\\"\\n\\nThis lack of depth, coupled with an underwhelming storyline, seems to be the main criticism for Do Patti. The suspense elements appear diluted by a script that doesn't quite pull the audience into its web as effectively as hoped.\\n\\nDespite the movie's flaws, Kriti Sanon's portrayal of the twins is being hailed as one of the best performances of her career. One fan tweeted, \\\"Kriti! The way you portrayed Shailee and Saumya was effortless. You pulled off such contrasting personalities with such ease. Just too good! Shailee & Saumya are going to be one of the most memorable characters.\\\"\\n\\nDo patti movie review - Engaging and interesting first half. The second half is disturbing.

New ERA was made possible by President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which makes the largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936.\\n\\nNew ERA program funding is available to member-owned rural electric cooperatives, which have been the backbone of America's rural power delivery for nearly a century. Today's investment in rural co-ops will create good-paying jobs and make energy more affordable for families in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, Minnesota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming.\\n\\n\\\"Since day one of his administration, President Biden has remained committed to ensuring rural communities are directly benefitting from a clean energy economy,\\\" Secretary Vilsack said. \\\"Through today's announcement, USDA is delivering on this commitment with critical funding from the President's historic Inflation Reduction Act. These projects will strengthen America's energy security while increasing access to affordable and reliable clean energy for people across the nation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Inflation Reduction Act makes the largest investment in rural electrification since FDR and the New Deal in the 1930s,\\\" said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. \\\"Today's awards will bring clean, affordable, reliable power to rural Americans from Colorado to Texas to South Carolina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All across America, rural electric cooperatives play an important role in delivering reliable sources of energy to rural communities. Under President Biden and Vice President Harris's leadership, we are making significant investments to ensure that those communities are receiving clean, carbon-free energy - which will reduce the pollution in our air and water, create good-paying jobs, and lower families' home energy costs,\\\" said White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. \\\"By helping rural cooperatives upgrade infrastructure and invest in newer, lower cost clean electricity projects, these investments will benefit rural families and businesses who for too long have faced disproportionately high energy costs due to the challenges of providing electricity in remote communities.\\\"\\n\\nToday in Westminster, Colorado, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Torres Small joined the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association to highlight the benefits of the nearly $2.5 billion in financing, made possible by a combination of grants and loans through the program. Tri-State's award is expected to reduce electricity rates 10 percent for cooperative members by 2034, amassing $430 million in rural consumer benefits over ten years. New ERA funds will finance the purchase of 1,040 megawatts of renewable energy and more than 200 megawatts of energy storage. New ERA funds will also help Tri-State refinance the retirement of 1,100 megawatts of previously and newly announced coal-fired energy generation. The investments will provide affordable, reliable, and resilient energy to Tri-State's cooperative members across Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Wyoming. This investment will reduce climate pollution by nearly 5.8 million tons annually. This transformative investment is expected to create more than 2,000 jobs.\\n\\nUSDA also announced six electric cooperatives to move forward in the New ERA process. The six cooperatives are:\\n\\nUSDA will be investing nearly $1 billion in grants and loans for these six new selectees, which will leverage investments of $6.4 billion for 1.75 gigawatts of clean energy for rural communities across the country. The selectees announced today will reduce and avoid at least 6.4 million tons of greenhouse gases annually.\\n\\nIncluding today's announcements, USDA has announced over $8.3 billion in funding as part of the New ERA program to benefit rural electric cooperatives and their members through the New ERA program. USDA expects this over $8.3 billion to result in over $13 billion in New ERA financed grants and loans. These projects will create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for rural communities, significantly reduce pollution, enhance the resiliency of the nation's electric grid, and advance the Biden-Harris Administration's Justice40 Initiative. One in five rural Americans will benefit from these clean energy investments.\\n\\nFarmer Benefit Plan\\n\\nUSDA also announced the release of a Farmer Benefit Plan as an innovative way for New ERA awardees to demonstrate ways for agricultural producers to benefit from clean energy projects. USDA encourages each award recipient to collaborate with local stakeholders to develop a Community Benefit Plan. During the first year of the award, applicants will collaborate with their communities and local farm associations to codevelop a plan. Based on the New ERA applications received so far, coops are collaborating with 154 local community groups, including 50 farm organizations, to explore local priorities.\\n\\nAs part of their New ERA award, Tri-State will develop a Farmer Benefit Plan that aims to lower electricity costs for farmers who voluntarily participate in a smart irrigation program. The goal of the program is to reduce pumping load at the times of peak demand. This will help reduce future energy needs and offset the need to build new transmission and generation, saving cooperative members from future costs. Tri-State will work with farmers to execute additional energy programs to encourage the most efficient use of electricity and water and will provide no-cost technical support to enable participation in these opportunities.

These results, combined with those from the ADORING 1 and ADORING 2 pivotal studies, demonstrate VTAMA cream's potential ability to not only effectively and safely treat patients as young as 2 years of age with atopic dermatitis, but may also enable a majority to achieve complete disease clearance, and maintain either clear or almost clear skin for an average of over 2 and a half months while off all treatment.\\\"\\n\\nADORING 1 and ADORING 2 were two identical, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of VTAMA cream, 1% in adults and pediatric patients as young as 2 years old with AD who had a Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 3 (moderate) to 4 (severe) at baseline. ADORING 3, a 48-week open-label, long-term extension (LTE) study, enrolled eligible patients from ADORING 1, ADORING 2, a 4-week maximal usage pharmacokinetics study, and VTAMA cream-naive patients aged 2-17 years with either mild, moderate or severe AD that did not meet inclusion in ADORING 1 and ADORING 2.\\n\\nIn ADORING 3, patients were followed for up to 48 weeks, with safety and tolerability endpoints that included treatment emergent adverse events, adverse events of special interest, investigator-assessed and patient\\/caregiver-assessed local tolerability, and efficacy endpoints that included the achievement of complete disease clearance (vIGA-AD=0), and the achievement of clear or almost clear skin (vIGA-AD=0 or 1). Patients entering with any disease activity (vIGA-AD\\u22651) were treated with VTAMA cream, 1% until complete disease clearance was achieved (vIGA-AD=0). Those entering with or achieving complete clearance (vIGA-AD=0) discontinued VTAMA cream, 1% and were followed to measure the treatment-free interval, defined as the maintenance of clear or almost clear skin (vIGA-AD=0 or 1) for consecutive days while no longer receiving any treatment for AD. Patients whose AD returned to mild or above (vIGA-AD\\u22652) were re-treated until complete disease clearance (vIGA-AD=0) was achieved again. ADORING 3 reinforced the safety and tolerability of VTAMA cream, 1% demonstrated in ADORING 1 and ADORING 2.\\n\\nADORING 3 LTE Skin Clearance and Other Results:\\n\\n728 patients enrolled in ADORING 3; of which 83.0% were pediatric patients (2-17 years) proportionally balanced across defined pediatric age groups. Overall, 51.9% (378\\/728) of patients entered with or achieved complete disease clearance (vIGA-AD=0) at least once during the 48-week study, while 81.6% (594\\/728) entered with or achieved clear or almost clear skin (vIGA-AD=0 or 1) at least once during the 48-week study. After entering with or first achieving complete disease clearance and discontinuing VTAMA cream, 1% treatment (n=378), the average duration of the first treatment-free interval was 79.8 consecutive days (with a standard deviation of 81.4 days). After achieving vIGA-AD=0 and discontinuing VTAMA cream, 1%, patients whose vIGA-AD returned to \\u22652 (mild or above) off-treatment could regain vIGA-AD=0 when re-treated. No evidence of tachyphylaxis (loss of response) in patients receiving either continuous or intermittent therapy of VTAMA cream, 1% was observed for up to 48 weeks. Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate; the most frequent were folliculitis (12.1%), nasopharyngitis (6.9%), and upper respiratory tract infection (6.9%). Study discontinue rate due to TEAEs were low (2.6%). Adverse events of special interest (AESI), follicular events, contact dermatitis, and headache were mostly mild or moderate and associated with low study discontinuation rates (1.0%, 0.4%, and 0% respectively). There was no study discontinuation due to headache. VTAMA cream, 1% was well tolerated, even when applied to affected sensitive skin areas, including the face (n=374) and neck (n=398).\\n\\nVTAMA cream, 1% is a novel, aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist in development in the U.S. as a once-daily, cosmetically elegant, and steroid-free, topical cream for both acute treatment and long-term management of AD. VTAMA cream, 1% is currently approved for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults in the U.S. In April 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the company's Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for VTAMA\\u00ae (tapinarof) cream, 1% for the topical treatment of AD in adults and children 2 years of age and older.

AD occurs most frequently in children, affecting up to 20% worldwide. The disease results in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin, often affecting the folds of the arms, back of the knees, hands, face, and neck. Itching is an especially bothersome symptom in AD, and tends to worsen at night, disturbing sleep and causing fatigue, which in children can lead to inattention at school. People with AD may also experience social and emotional distress due to the visibility and discomfort of the disease.\\n\\nAbout Dermavant\\n\\nDermavant Sciences, a subsidiary of Roivant Sciences, is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics in immuno-dermatology.

It has filed for bankruptcy and renounced its status as a professional sports club. On Nov. 5, more than 80 people will lose their jobs in a 6 million euros ($6.5 million) redundancy plan. Without a new investor in sight one of France's proudest clubs faces a race against time to avoid liquidation.\\n\\n\\\"You feel so sad, disillusioned,\\\" said Alain Giresse, a club legend who scored 182 goals in 592 appearances in the 1970's and '80s. \\\"It's not a club that destroyed itself, it's a club that has been destroyed (by) the people in charge.\\\"\\n\\nThe team now plays in the National 2 league -- three rungs below France's top tier -- against opponents from towns with as few as 10,000 residents. By contrast, Bordeaux, a tourist destination world-renowned for its prestigious wines, counts about 1 million people in its metropolitan area.\\n\\nIf that's an unfamiliar situation for the club, the same can be said for its top player, former England and Liverpool striker Andy Carroll, who joined Bordeaux this summer.\\n\\n\\\"I knew the situation they were in and when I spoke to them, I knew there was a project there,\\\" Carroll, 35, told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \\\"It's a club that deserves to be at the top with the stadium, the training ground, the fans, everything that the club has to give.\\\"\\n\\nBordeaux's misfortune shows how a longtime top-level club can plummet through the league system of European soccer, which unlike U.S. professional sports operates on a system of promotion and relegation whereby teams at the bottom of a league drop down a level the following season.\\n\\nFounded in 1936, FC Girondins de Bordeaux has played a total of 75 seasons in France's top division and won its latest league title in 2009. It has also won four French cups, three League Cups and reached the 1996 UEFA Cup final.\\n\\nThe club's training ground is named after the 19th century Ch\\u00e2teau du Haillan, which sits at the heart of its sweeping meadows, befitting the aesthetic aura of a club graced by elegant playmakers like Giresse, Zidane and Yoann Gourcuff. In 2010, Haillan buzzed with anticipation when a Gourcuff-inspired Bordeaux reached the Champions League quarterfinals.\\n\\nNow almost every training pitch is empty.\\n\\n\\\"It's like a place that no is longer alive, there's nothing there,\\\" Giresse told AP by telephone.\\n\\nAfter the resolution of a dispute over matchday costs with the owners, Bordeaux has returned to the 42,000-capacity Matmut Atlantique stadium, which hosted soccer matches during the Paris Olympics. But the remote location, 40 minutes from the center by tram, adds to the impression of an isolated white elephant. During a league game on Oct. 19 against Avranches, a Normandy team, the food stalls were shut and fans sat on benches eating their own provisions like a surreal picnic.\\n\\nDenis Barbet, who has followed Bordeaux since the '80s, was deeply upset by the youth academy's closure.\\n\\n\\\"It's a catastrophe with all the people who lost their jobs,\\\" Barbet, 57, said. \\\"The training center is emblematic of the club, the Ch\\u00e2teau du Haillan is exceptional. When you've known that and the glory days, and now there's nothing left and everything's been abandoned, it's heart-breaking.\\\"\\n\\nHis son, Yoann Barbet, came through the academy and captained Bordeaux last season when it finished 12th in division two.\\n\\nAs another lifelong fan, Regis Marty used to watch Giresse and Zidane in the glory days and fears a bleak future.\\n\\n\\\"There are not many solutions other than a good buyer,\\\" Marty, 61, said. \\\"I don't believe it will happen. I want it with all my heart, but it will be difficult.\\\"\\n\\nDuring the game, the club's main supporter groups, Ultramarines and North Gate, expressed differing views about the club's leadership.\\n\\nWhile the Ultramarines unfurled a giant banner talking about \\\"renewed hope\\\" the North Gate urged club president G\\u00e9rard Lopez to \\\"get lost\\\" and let off flares with black smoke in protest.\\n\\nBordeaux won 1-0 with Carroll's fifth goal in three matches.\\n\\n\\\"Right now I'm running around out there every day feeling like I'm still 17,\\\" Carroll said. \\\"I feel really good in myself and in my life, in football and outside the club.\\\"\\n\\nCarroll's heading ability and remarkable chest-trapping of the ball set him apart in amateur soccer. Hardly surprising, considering he played 16 seasons in the Premier League and scored twice for England.\\n\\nCarroll cost Liverpool 35 million pounds ($46 million) when he joined from Newcastle in January 2011. Back then, he was the Premier League's most expensive British transfer signing.\\n\\nAfter years with injury problems, he joined French second-division team Amiens last season and moved to Bordeaux this year. His salary is undisclosed, but the maximum monthly wage in the amateur league is 3,500 euros ($3,800).\\n\\n\\\"When I first came here, I wanted to challenge myself, something different,\\\" Carroll said. \\\"I didn't know how it was going to be.\\\"\\n\\nHe has experienced deafening atmospheres at St. James' Park in Newcastle and Anfield in Liverpool. So what does he think about playing away against Saumur in a 2,500-capacity stadium?\\n\\n\\\"I love it, think it's brilliant. That's what grassroots football is about, that's where I started and it just brings back a lot of memories,\\\" Carroll said. \\\"It's just a great feeling just to play football and still have the fans there at my age. It doesn't matter if there's just a rope around the pitch or a big stadium.\\\"\\n\\nGeneral American Capital Partners bought Bordeaux from long-term owner M6 television channel in 2018, then sold it to backer King Street.\\n\\nThe pandemic and a collapsed television deal caused French soccer huge losses. When King Street pulled out, Lopez acquired Bordeaux in June 2021. The following season it finished last in Ligue 1 and was relegated.\\n\\nAs Bordeaux narrowly missed out on moving back up the next year, Lopez offset huge financial losses by writing a shareholder's loan to Bordeaux for 38 million euros.\\n\\nAhead of this season, the club failed to provide financial guarantees to French soccer's financial watchdog, the DNCG. After a deal with potential backers The Fenway Sports Group -- which owns Liverpool and the Boston Red Sox -- fell through, the DNCG demoted Bordeaux to the third tier in July. Bordeaux was placed into receivership by the city's commercial court, which triggered another relegation but at least meant a debt freeze.\\n\\nFifty academy players were released, generating short-term savings but depriving the club of future revenue from selling homegrown talent.\\n\\nFormer players like Giresse, Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, want Lopez out. So does city mayor Pierre Hurmic. Going into liquidation could enforce that, but Bordeaux would drop into the abyss of regional leagues.\\n\\nLopez didn't respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nBordeaux, at mid-table early in the season, needs two promotions to return to professional soccer so therefore plenty of goals from Carroll, who is optimistic despite the scale of the challenge.\\n\\n\\\"There's a massive pressure on us anyway, being who we are, to get promoted,\\\" Carroll said. \\\"If we can carry on winning games I think the pressure's going to be on the other teams to stop us.\\\"\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"hosted.ap.org\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"Associated Press\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"summary_large_image\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":0.06666666666666665, \"wgt\":467555115, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380484564\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:25:15\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:25:15Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:59Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/triblive.com\\/news\\/world\\/hungarys-orban-claims-polands-center-right-government-was-installed-by-the-eu\\/\", \"title\":\"Hungary's Orb\\u00e1n claims Poland's center-right government was installed by the EU\", \"body\":\"BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\\u00e1n suggested on Friday that Poland's government and its prime minister, Donald Tusk, were installed by the European Union as part of a plot to remove the country's previous right-wing populist leadership.\\n\\nOrb\\u00e1n provided no evidence to substantiate his claims about Poland's government, which was elected in 2023 with record high voter turnout of nearly 74%.\\n\\nThe comments came two days after Orb\\u00e1n, a nationalist who has taken an increasingly adversarial approach to the EU, told supporters in a speech that the bloc seeks to topple his government and install a puppet regime in Hungary.\\n\\nSpeaking to state radio Friday, Orb\\u00e1n lashed out at EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and the leader of the bloc's largest political group, European People's Party president Manfred Weber, claiming they were seeking to replace his government as he said they had in Poland in 2023, when a coalition led by Tusk defeated the governing Law and Justice party in national elections.\\n\\n\\\"It's not even a secret conspiracy against Hungary, it is an openly represented, announced plan,\\\" Orb\\u00e1n said of the alleged plot against him, for which he has not provided evidence. \\\"The same thing happened in Poland.

Poland's previous nationalist-conservative government also spent years wrangling with the EU over democratic deficiencies.\\n\\nIn response, Orb\\u00e1n has taken an increasingly combative approach to the bloc, which Hungary joined in 2004, and rallied euro-skeptic parties across the EU to create a far-right political force in the bloc's legislature. He has also moved Hungary closer to autocracies like Russia and China, seeking foreign investment and loans from Moscow and Beijing as EU funds dried up over his conduct.\\n\\nTusk's government has sought to restore Poland's democratic institutions that he sees as having been dismantled under the previous Orb\\u00e1n-allied government, but has maintained some conservative policies such as a tough stance on illegal immigration.\\n\\nOrb\\u00e1n, who faces national elections in early 2026, compared the EU to the former Soviet Union in the interview Friday.\\n\\n\\\"They're going to be working on this.

The victory makes it three wins out of three for Ange Postecoglou's side in Europe, with only Lazio and Anderlecht also possessing a 100% win rate.\\n\\nWhile Richarlison's penalty secured maximum points for the Premier League side, it was Moore who was subject to significant praise from Maddison. The England star - who was captain in the absence of Son Heung-min - delivered the ultimate compliment to his teenage team-mate by comparing a portion of his second half performance to one of the game's modern day greats.\\n\\n\\\"From minute 45 to 65 I thought we had Neymar on the left wing. He was brilliant. Just demanding the ball and fearless,\\\" he told TNT Sports. \\\"[He has] that young, fearless mentality and you never want to take that away from him.\\n\\n\\\"He's a young kid, a brilliant lad, a lovely boy. He takes in information, and he's got bags of ability, so I'll be there as an older player, hopefully with some wise words to help along the way. He's got all the ability. It's just about knuckling down and working hard, which he does to be fair to him.\\\"\\n\\nPostecoglou doubled down on the praise towards Moore, describing the youngster's progression as an exciting project for Spurs. \\\"[In the second half] we put Mikey on the left,\\\" the Aussie explained. \\\"I think he's more comfortable, as you saw, playing on the left-hand side.

water firm need emergency...\", \"body\":\"Thames Water has said it is seeking up to \\u00a33 billion in emergency loans in order to stay afloat until at least October next year.\\n\\nThe proposals would see the supplier borrow an initial \\u00a31.5 billion from its creditors, amid concerns the company could run out of cash early next year.\\n\\nIt will then seek another \\u00a31.5 billion depending on an upcoming decision by industry regulators.\\n\\nHere the PA news agency explains why the water company needs more money and what it could mean for customers.\\n\\n- What is Thames Water?\\n\\nThames Water is the UK's largest water supplier.\\n\\nThe utilities giant supplies around 16 million households across London and the South East.\\n\\nIt was formed after the privatisation of water and sewage businesses in the UK in 1989 by the Conservative government.\\n\\nThames Water supplies around 16 million households across London and the South East (Andrew Matthews\\/PA)\\n\\n- Who owns Thames Water?\\n\\nThames Water is owned by a group of investors, ranging from pensions funds to sovereign wealth funds.\\n\\nThe largest single owner is Canadian pension fund OMERS, which owns almost a third of the business.\\n\\nThe Universities Superannuation Scheme, a pension fund for UK academics, is the second-largest shareholder.\\n\\n- What are the company's finances like?\\n\\nThe company has come under greater scrutiny in recent years because of it heavy debt burden and the pressure of this on its operations.\\n\\nThames Water was left with around \\u00a310 billion in debt when it was sold by previous owner Macquarie in 2017.\\n\\nIt currently has around \\u00a315 billion in debt, which is expected to keep increasing thanks to high debt interest costs after a recent rise in borrowing costs.\\n\\nThe company swung back to a profit in its latest financial year but has been seeking longer-term funding in order to secure its finances.\\n\\n- Why has the business proposed a new funding deal?\\n\\nThames Water has eaten significantly into its cash position over the past year as it pays off its significant debt interest and investment commitments.\\n\\nOn Friday, the company said it had only \\u00a3500 million left, excluding another \\u00a3500 million set aside for reserves and compensation payments.\\n\\nIn July, the company said it had \\u00a31.8 billion of liquidity, which would be enough to tide it over until May next year.\\n\\nIt has now said it would need the extra \\u00a31.5 billion in funding to keep it operating until next October, with further cash needed to help it in the long run.\\n\\nThe group is also looking at separate equity options and a potential restructuring of debt.\\n\\n53%\\n\\nHow much Thames Water requested to raise bills by for the next five years\\n\\n- What does this mean for customers?\\n\\nThe company has called for significant price increases for its customers to help bring in more revenues and help it fund its turnaround plan.\\n\\nIt most recently asked water regulator Ofwat to allow it to hike prices by 53% for the next five years.\\n\\nOfwat said earlier this year it would allow average prices across water firms to be lifted by 23% over the period.\\n\\nThere have since been reports that Ofwat could allow for a sharper rise in its final decision after pressure from water firms and their investors.\\n\\nOfwat is expected to confirm its final decision on how much companies can increase their bills by December this year.\\n\\nThames Water has said it will need to access more of its potential \\u00a33 billion of funding if Ofwat does not allow it to hike prices as much as it hopes, although it would therefore be likely to launch an appeal to the regulator.\\n\\nEnvironment Secretary Steve Reed has ruled out bringing water companies back into public ownership (Peter Byrne\\/PA)\\n\\n- Is Thames Water heading for emergency nationalisation?\\n\\nIt has previously been reported that the Government has worked on a plan which could allow it to effectively nationalise the water giant.\\n\\nHowever, earlier this week the Environment Secretary said nationalising water firms would cost up to \\u00a3100 billion and \\\"not resolve the problems\\\" faced by customers.\\n\\nSteve Reed ruled out bringing the companies back into public ownership as he outlined an independent review into the industry following a public outcry over bills, bonuses and sewage pollution.\\n\\nThe independent review into the water industry could consider abolishing regulator Ofwat among potential measures to reform the sector.\\n\\n- What happens next for Thames?\\n\\nThames Water's next key steps will both begin in December.\\n\\nIn December it is expected to receive a final decision from Ofwat over how much it can increase customer bills for the next five years.\\n\\nThis will affect how much money the company will bring in and, therefore, how financially viable its current turnaround plans will be.\\n\\nIn December, it will also start the court proceedings in order to complete the initial \\u00a31.5 billion part of its funding plan. It hopes to complete this by January next year.\\n\\nThe company has said it will continue to supply customers and run services as normal for the meantime.\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"dailymail.co.uk\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"Daily Mail Online\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2024\\/10\\/25\\/12\\/wire-91280739-1729857445-770_636x382.jpg\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":0.0117647058823529, \"wgt\":467555107, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380484180\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:25:07\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:25:07Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:48Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/stupiddope.com\\/2024\\/10\\/sean-wotherspoon-and-fat-international-rev-up-fashion-with-limited-fatlanta-collection\\/\", \"title\":\"Sean Wotherspoon and FAT International Rev Up Fashion with Limited FATlanta Collection | stupidDOPE\", \"body\":\"Streetwear designer Sean Wotherspoon has teamed up once again with FAT International, delivering the highly anticipated FATlanta collection.

Benjamin Franklin. Betsy Ross. The two Founding Fathers and the seamstress of the American flag all once worshipped on the now centuries-old wooden pews of Christ Church.\\n\\nIt's the site of colonial America's break with the Church of England -- and where the U.S. Episcopal Church was born.\\n\\nLess than a mile south, past Independence Hall, Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church stands on the oldest parcel of land continuously owned by Black Americans. It's the mother church of the nation's first Black denomination.\\n\\nTwo churches, across the centuries. Generations after their birth in this nation first envisioned in Philadelphia, both churches continue to serve as the spiritual home for hundreds in the city.\\n\\nChurch members see the role of their congregation as crucial, a beacon ahead of a contentious presidential election in Pennsylvania -- the most pivotal of swing states. They also express concerns about political division that the Founding Fathers once feared could tear the nation apart.\\n\\n\\\"We've grown as a nation, but I think at this point, we're at a standstill. We're terribly divided,\\\" said Christ Church parishioner Jeanette Morris. A registered Republican, she previously voted for former President Donald Trump, but plans to back Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5 because of her support for reproductive rights. Morris is concerned about health issues following the repeal of Roe v. Wade.\\n\\n\\\"Nothing is getting done in Washington because nobody can agree on anything,\\\" she said after a recent service. \\\"I pray every Sunday that we can get past this all.\\\"\\n\\nToday's list of divisive issues is long: from abortion and immigration to taxes, climate change and the wars abroad. It's also the first presidential election since an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, an act of political violence steeped in the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.\\n\\n\\\"I think things have changed: Slavery is abolished. The Civil Rights Act was put in place. But still, deep down, the denizens of the United States haven't really come together,\\\" says Keith Matthews, 61, a Mother Bethel AME parishioner. \\\"There's still a lot of hatred and misunderstanding amongst the races.\\\"\\n\\nAt its infancy, the United States of America also was deeply divided. And some members of Christ Church -- from Washington to the parish rector -- seemed to be at the center of it all.\\n\\n\\\"What we're going through right now is certainly unprecedented politically. And there's a huge amount of potential instability and concern that a lot of people have in this church and the United States,\\\" says Zack Biro, executive director of the Christ Church Preservation Trust. \\\"And Christ Church is a perfect example of kind of weathering that storm.\\\"\\n\\nThe church was founded in 1695 by a group of Philadelphia colonists as the first parish of the Church of England in Pennsylvania. Congregants later included slaves and their owners, loyalists and patriots. They listened to sermons favoring and opposing independence.\\n\\nAnglican clergy loyal to the British king led weekly prayers for the monarch. But on July 4, 1776, Christ Church's vestry crossed out the king's name from the Book of Common Prayer -- a defiant act of potential treason. The book is preserved today in an underground museum, a testament to the church's revolutionary spirit on Independence Day.\\n\\n\\\"We tend to think that the early American republic was a time of great unity, but, like today, the political culture was deeply polarized,\\\" says John Fea, a professor of American history at Messiah University in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nDuring the 1780s, Fea said via email, debate raged about how to apply revolutionary-era principles such as liberty or freedom to all Americans. From the pulpit, the Rev. Jacob Duch\\u00e9, the church's rector, was seen as a moderate and led prayers as the first chaplain of the Continental Congress. But then he sided with the loyalists.\\n\\nWhen the British occupied Philadelphia in 1777, the rector wrote a letter to Washington urging him to surrender and reach a deal with the British. After the letter became public, Duch\\u00e9 traveled to England. Pennsylvania officials later labeled him a traitor and banned his reentry. His successor, the Rev. William White, became the first presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church. He's praised for keeping the unity of his congregation during times of turmoil.\\n\\nChrist Church's current senior pastor is the Rev. Samantha Vincent-Alexander, the first woman to serve as rector in its more than 300-year history.\\n\\n\\\"The idea of what do we do in this political environment right now and how do we deal with that is an incredible challenge,\\\" she says. \\\"Most of our congregations are not a unified voting bloc. They represent different people much like at the time of the American revolution.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We had people who were loyalists and people who supported independence, and the clergy at the time had to find a way to keep the congregation together.\\\"\\n\\nCongregants remain proud of Christ Church's crucial role in America's freedom. But they also grapple with contradictions. Some church members traded slaves and are buried in the church yard near signers of the Declaration of Independence. Franklin's tomb is in the nearby Christ Church burial ground.\\n\\n\\\"While we're very proud of our history, these people were not perfect. Sometimes we tend to think of them that way, but they weren't,\\\" says Harvey Bartle, a congregant for more than 30 years. \\\"What they were doing is trying to promote democracy. ... At least they advanced the ball beyond the divine right of kings, so that the society, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, could advance the system.\\\"\\n\\nOne church member, Absalom Jones, attended services while enslaved to a man serving in the church leadership. Jones bought his freedom and eventually became ordained as the first Black priest of the Episcopal Church. He also went on to co-create the Free African Society of Philadelphia, which Fea says \\\"sought to apply the rights secured from the American Revolution to the 2,000 or so free Black men and women living in the city at the time.\\\"\\n\\nMethodism was the fastest growing denomination in America in the 1790s. But some Methodist Episcopal Churches still segregated Black worshippers during services to the upstairs galleries. This prompted free Black Americans to start their own congregation.\\n\\nThe African Methodist Episcopal Church has been involved in the struggle for freedom and equality from its roots.\\n\\nIts founder, the Rev. Richard Allen, was born into slavery in Philadelphia in 1760 before buying his freedom in Delaware before he was 20. He returned to the city in the 1780s and became a minister.\\n\\nAfter white leaders at a Methodist church segregated Allen, Jones and other Black worshippers to the upstairs galleries for a prayer service, the group left the church and formed what would eventually become Mother Bethel AME. The church became a place of refuge for Black people fleeing slavery along the Underground Railroad and later a major gathering point for the Civil Rights Movement.\\n\\nBy creating Mother Bethel, Allen \\\"carved out a space where Black people could resist ... at a time where during slavery in the Deep South, Black people could not even congregate without the presence of a white man in between them,\\\" says Bethel AME's pastor, the Rev. Mark Tyler.\\n\\nToday, the AME Church has more than 2.5 million members and thousands of congregations in dozens of nations worldwide.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, we've made progress,\\\" says Tyler, citing Kamala Harris' campaign to become the country's first Black female president. But he also believes that much more needs to be done to bridge America's racial inequality and he worries about the potential of another Trump presidency. The AME Church, he says, has not \\\"outlived its usefulness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The fact that we have a person who openly embraces white supremacists, who has been president once and potentially could be president again in the 21st century, is all the evidence that you need to know that we still need places for Black people to come together and organize like the Black Church,\\\" he says.\\n\\nDuring a recent Sunday service, Tyler encouraged his congregation to vote. Some members later reflected on America's beginnings and its progress and shortcomings.\\n\\n\\\"Two things can be said at the same time: They were brilliant in the development of this nation. But they still carried slavery ideas, women were not allowed to vote, and that needed to be changed,\\\" parishioner Donna Matthews said about the Founding Fathers.\\n\\n\\\"Who are 'We the people'? I think people need to ask themselves that,\\\" said Matthews, 63, who attended the service with her husband, Keith, and their young grandson, Ezekiel. \\\"It's everyone. And it's the essence of why this church was started.\\\"\\n\\nAt the end of the service, parishioner Tayza Hill, 25, led groups on a tour of the church's museum. It preserves an original wooden pulpit used by the Rev. Allen and Black leaders including abolitionist Frederick Douglass and civil rights pioneer W.E.B. Du Bois when they addressed the congregation.\\n\\nHill says she has been hearing the same question in radio shows as the election approaches: \\\"Is the sun rising, or is the sun setting on democracy?\\\" She remains hopeful and believes the continuity of her church is vital.\\n\\n\\\"Seeing that there's still a building that has the history and is continuously being told is important because it's refusing to be erased from history,\\\" Hill says. \\\"As a nation and as a church, it's really up to us to defend the rights and the respectability of those who are withheld the full opportunity of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.\\\"\\n\\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

She also said HIV prevention had not been adequately integrated into national responses and remained underfunded.\\n\\n\\\"We are living in a world of multiple consecutive crises, which threaten the global HIV response. These include rising commodity prices, shifts in multilateralism, debt crises, poverty, and the worsening impacts of climate change,\\\" Ms Chikukwa said.\\n\\nShe said Lesotho was one of the few countries on track to controlling the HIV epidemic, having met the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets. However, she urged the country to focus on transforming its HIV response to ensure sustainability by 2030 and beyond. This, she said, required both political and financial commitment.\\n\\n\\\"The next phase of our HIV response demands that we refocus efforts on critical gaps in prevention, treatment, care, and support, particularly among specific sub-populations or geographic areas. This transformation should also ensure the integration of HIV responses into broader health and social systems while achieving more with fewer resources,\\\" she explained.\\n\\nShe added that it was essential to safeguard unique aspects of the response, including community-led initiatives and systems, and to address human rights and gender-related challenges.\\n\\nThe HIV and AIDS Program Manager at the Ministry of Health, Tapiwa Tarumbiswa, echoed these sentiments, outlining the ministry's vision for the future. He expressed hope that, in the future, HIV and TB epidemics will no longer be considered perpetual threats.\\n\\n\\\"We envision a future where all people in Lesotho have access to high-quality, universal HIV and TB prevention, treatment, and care services. These services should be primarily managed and sustained using domestic resources, whether in human resources, health information systems, supply chains, laboratories, quality assurance, or financing,\\\" Dr Tarumbiswa said.\\n\\nHe also outlined the three main goals aligned with the national strategic and health sector plans. The first goal is to reduce new infections, aiming for zero new HIV infections in Lesotho. However, by 2028, they realistically expect to see around 2600 new infections annually.\\n\\n\\\"As of the end of 2023, new infections were estimated at 4800,\\\" he added.\\n\\nAnother target is to reduce mother-to-child transmission to less than 2 percent by 2038. Additionally, they aim to reduce new annual HIV infections to be lower than the number of HIV-related deaths. \\\"As of the end of 2023, the HIV mortality rate stood at 5.1 percent.\\\"\\n\\nThe final goal is to increase knowledge of HIV status among people living with the virus. By 2028, they aim for 98 percent of people living with HIV to know their status and be linked to treatment to reduce the chances of transmitting the virus.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Lesotho People's Congress (LPC) Member of Parliament, Reverend Paul Masiu, commended Lesotho's progress in reaching global HIV targets, placing the country among the few to have achieved epidemic control. However, he emphasized that the country still faced significant challenges in tackling tuberculosis (TB).\\n\\n\\\"Lesotho remains one of the 30 countries with the highest TB and TB\\/HIV burden globally. While we are close to achieving the 95-95-95 targets for HIV epidemic control, disparities remain across demographics and sub-populations.

I am not an expert on Canadian law about open carrying so I will not be able to say that. But most likely they would have said that it was 'kirpan' which is a small blade whereas they had swords in their hand. They could come very, very close to me,\\\" said Verma.\\n\\nWhen asked if the incident was reported, Sanjay Verma said, \\\"It was all reported and we were told that investigations are on.\\\"\\n\\nSpeaking of intimidation from the Khalistanis, Sanjay Verma that the intimidation came through banned organisations associated with the Khalistani extremists.\\n\\n\\\"Some came through emails during the so-called protests, which I call hooliganism when they gathered in front of the two consulates or the High Commission. They would shout slogans to intimidate us. Whenever we were attending public events, again, they would shout slogans to intimidate us,\\\" he said.\\n\\nSharing an incident, Sanjay Verma said, \\\"In one instance, close to Diwali, they created 10 heads for me, called me Ravan.

Then what is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I reported this to the foreign ministry. The response was that we forwarded it to the relevant authorities, which is correct. We also do the same.

Not to come out,\\\" he stated.\\n\\nWhen asked if he at any point in time he felt threatened physically?\\n\\nSanjay Verma replied, \\\" Threatened, yes. But did I become threatened? No. In most of my public events, there will be these hooligans outside shouting slogans against India, but also against me. Some of them are very burly-looking tall guys who would also gesture to physically harm me, but just the gestures, except for a few incidents. And so they tried.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They came close to me. They tried to intimidate me through such, slogans shouting, and abusing me verbally.

They were very professional, well-trained, and very respectful. So as far as the police officers who were protecting us and now protecting my colleagues there, very, very professional, never had an iota of doubt on their professionalism.\\\"\\n\\nAdding further he said, \\\"But unfortunately, the statement which we saw in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police press briefing, where even the investigation has not been concluded, that was a sad thing to see.\\\"\\n\\nHigh Commissioner Verma said that he was there to serve India's national interest and was committed to doing so.\\n\\n\\\"So diplomacy for most of us would be, you know, being nice, nice cities.

Many just want to sabotage our exceptionalism, and fundamentally transform us -- into The Americas first, then the United Nations. Not only politically and economically, but also culturally.\\n\\nTrump's plans to mass deport the illegal aliens will help salvage American values, but, in the meantime, our society's preferences have already been transformed. A few of our favorite things are distinctly un-American.\\n\\nAmericans adore our pets, and dogs are the most popular. Representing a radical transformation of preferences, Chihuahuas are now ranked number one.\\n\\nChihuahuas?! That's less of a dog than a poodle, for heaven's sake. Invoking Plato's Forms (abstract things and concepts that most accurately represent reality) as the benchmark, Chihuahuas would barely qualify under the Form of dog-ness. They are absent from the local dog-walking group, for example. In fact, they are nowhere to be seen at the local dog park, but somehow these lapdogs have become the most popular breed in America. We are really in decline.\\n\\nUntil recently, proper dogs like Labradors were perennially the most popular breed, per the American Kennel Club. Other favored breeds include real dogs like Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, and Bulldogs. Poodles also usually make the top 10, but that's probably because 68% of females own dogs (compared to 80% of men), and poodles sport quite a feminine disposition.\\n\\nChihuahuas are fine, I suppose, having basic traits that humans favor, such as loyalty. The best thing about a Chihuahua is that it is not a Shih-Tzu, still, they are rather unaesthetic and yappy. Unsurprisingly, they are particularly prevalent in the West, including New Mexico.\\n\\nWhich leads to considerations of other trends that may be influenced by old Mexico. In some staples, the popularity of products from one of our biggest trading partners now surpass good ole American stalwarts.\\n\\nOdds are that if someone allows a Chihuahua to domicile with them, their favorite beer is Modelo, another import from Mexico. Indeed, Modelo Especial has recently risen to America's favorite beer. Sure, Bud's demise was hastened after their misguided embrace of fringe sub-cultures, but what about Coors or Miller as an all-American replacement?\\n\\nFor those preferring to imbibe the hard stuff, one might consider whiskey, a good American bourbon or Tennessee brand, or perhaps a martini (shaken or stirred). Think again... Tequila is now the best-selling spirit in America. Authentic tequila is made in Mexico, mostly the state of Jalisco. President Trump has proposed a tariff on it.\\n\\nBetter not drink on an empty stomach, though, so perhaps a nice sandwich will hit the spot? Actually, tortilla sales have surpassed white sandwich bread as the first choice for enveloping tasty treats.\\n\\nFrom our beloved pets to our selected drinks and gastronomic desires, some of America's favorites -- the things that bring simple, everyday pleasure and contentment -- have been supplanted commensurate with invasions across our porous border. In these important cultural elements, we are gradually becoming The Americas.\\n\\nAs Lady Liberty projects her welcome to the world's downtrodden masses, we remain a generous and compassionate people to those who wish to assimilate legally. Nevertheless, Trump better resume his presidency (with loyal advisors) and start mass deportations -- of the criminal illegal aliens -- before we devolve into a nebulous country mirroring the United Nations. Some of their favorite things are rather repulsive.\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"americanthinker.com\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"American Thinker\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"https:\\/\\/images.americanthinker.com\\/ps\\/pss9mcoax8vz2wnrhim5_800.jpg\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":0.07450980392156858, \"wgt\":467555103, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380484115\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:25:03\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:25:03Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:43Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mercurynews.com\\/2024\\/10\\/25\\/dodgers-will-wear-patch-honoring-fernando-valenzuela-in-world-series\\/\", \"title\":\"Dodgers will wear patch honoring Fernando Valenzuela in World Series and 2025\", \"body\":\"LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers will wear a patch on their uniforms honoring Fernando Valenzuela during the World Series.\\n\\nValenzuela died this week at age 63.

Sub-Saharan African nations that depend on commodity exports need to reform their economies to tackle patchy regional economic growth, International Monetary Fund Africa Director Abebe Aemro Selassie said.\\n\\nThe region is expected to grow by 3.6% this year, unchanged from last year and down from an April forecast of 3.8%, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook released this week, with commodity economies lagging their diversified counterparts.\\n\\nThe commodity intensive countries are growing at about half the rate of the rest of the region, the IMF said in the report, with oil exporters struggling the most in what it described as \\\"subdued and uneven\\\" regional growth.\\n\\n\\\"South Sudan, Nigeria, Angola are all very much in that camp,\\\" Abebe told Reuters.\\n\\nWhile diversified economies such as Senegal and Tanzania are expected to grow at above the regional average, Nigeria will fall short, growing at 2.9%, according to the IMF's regional economic outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa launched on Friday.\\n\\n\\\"They have had very large macroeconomic imbalances, financing challenges which have held back growth,\\\" Abebe said.\\n\\nHe said the government in Nigeria needed to \\\"squarely address\\\" those challenges, since they had caused high inflation and put pressure on the cost of living.\\n\\nPresident Bola Tinubu's government has launched a series of reforms it says are aimed at lifting economic growth and attracting investment.\\n\\nSouth Africa, whose growth has been curbed by crippling electricity blackouts, is expected to grow by 1.1% this year, the IMF said.\\n\\nArmed conflicts are also weighing on growth, the IMF said, citing South Sudan's oil exports blocked by conflict in neighbouring Sudan, which hosts the crude export pipeline.\\n\\n\\\"They (oil exporters) need to find new sources of growth, get more private sector investment - so working on reforms that will facilitate that is important,\\\" Abebe said.\\n\\nOther challenges facing African oil producers include the global transition to green fuels due to climate change, the report said.\\n\\nSMALL REBOUND\\n\\nSub-Saharan Africa's economic growth is expected to improve slightly next year to 4.2%, the IMF report said.\\n\\nThe report found that nearly half of the 20 fastest growing economies in the world this year were in Sub-Saharan Africa, but cautioned that faster growth rates were required to reduce widespread poverty and inequalities.\\n\\nOne of the main obstacles to faster growth include a lack of access to affordable financing, the IMF said, as countries struggle with heavy debt loads and high debt servicing costs.\\n\\nWhile some countries have been able to sell bonds on international capital markets this year following a two-year hiatus caused by geopolitical shocks and elevated interest rates in advanced economies such as the United States, the new funding came at a high cost.\\n\\n\\\"The old development finance architecture is not delivering, and, if anything, kind of is in the process of disintegrating,\\\" Abebe said, citing \\\"very problematic levels\\\" of official bilateral funding for poor countries.\\n\\nFor countries such as Kenya, where deadly anti-tax hikes protests in June forced the government to withdraw its finance bill for this fiscal year, such development assistance from overseas has been falling in recent years, a senior U.N. official told Reuters.\\n\\nThe solutions lay in ensuring that poor nations continue to access low-priced development financing from bilateral and multilateral lenders, Abebe said.\\n\\n\\\"We need also to find ways in which when countries are facing liquidity rather than solvency challenges, more financing can be made available for them to support reforms so they can move on to better times,\\\" he said.\\n\\n(Reporting by Duncan Miriri and Karin Strohecker; Graphics by Sumanta Sen; Editing by Alison Williams)\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"dailymail.co.uk\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"Daily Mail Online\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":null, \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":-0.05882352941176472, \"wgt\":467555102, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380484196\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:25:02\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:25:02Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:49Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/allafrica.com\\/stories\\/202410250316.html\", \"title\":\"Somalia: Turkish Vessel Oruc Reis Docks At Mogadishu Port Ahead of Oil and Gas Exploration Off Somalia's Coast\", \"body\":\"Ankara, Turkey -- In a move to bolster its energy security and assert its maritime exploration capabilities, T\\u00fcrkiye's state-of-the-art seismic research vessel, Oruc Reis, has embarked on a significant mission to explore the seabed off Somalia for potential oil and natural gas deposits.\\n\\nThe announcement was made by Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar on Friday, marking a pivotal moment in the country's international energy strategy.\\n\\nBayraktar took to X to confirm the vessel's arrival, posting, \\\"Oruc Reis has reached its mission location after its journey across continents.\\\" This voyage not only represents T\\u00fcrkiye's commitment to expanding its energy portfolio but also highlights its capability to conduct advanced seismic surveys in regions far from its own coasts.\\n\\nThe deployment of Oruc Reis underscores T\\u00fcrkiye's ambition to tap into new hydrocarbon resources as part of a broader geopolitical strategy.

Why Shell's Divestment from the Niger Delta Must not Harm Human Rights\\\", held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\\n\\nDummett told the government that it must ensure that the divestment does not limit Shell's liabilities without a full investigation into and remediation of all existing pollution, the maintenance and repair of existing pipelines, and the protection of pipelines from sabotage.He said: \\\"Amnesty International has documented grievous and enduring human rights abuses resulting from oil contamination in the area, where Shell has operated since the 1950s. Amnesty International is concerned that the proposed sale will deny people already harmed access to adequate remedy, and potentially expose many more to future abuses.\\\"\\n\\nThe report recommends a series of safeguards and action to help protect the rights of people potentially affected by Shell's planned disposal of its onshore oil interest in the Niger Delta, reportedly for about US$3billion.\\n\\nSpeaking further, Dummett noted that \\\"For decades spills have damaged the health and livelihoods of many of the Niger Delta's inhabitants .\\\"\\n\\nAccording to him, \\\"Shell should not be allowed to wash its hands of the problems and leave. Shell has earned billions of dollars from this business and it must make sure that its withdrawal does not have negative human rights and environmental consequences.\\\"\\n\\nThe report also stated that \\\"The government should consider requiring Shell to act as guarantor to ensure any purchaser is capable of making good and remediating damage caused by any future spills and that any buyer is committed to transparency, environmental compliance, consultations with communities, and limiting greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\n\\\"By exercising appropriate oversight to Shell's sale, Nigeria's incoming administration has a unique opportunity to demonstrate its determination to upload and protect the human rights of its citizens, including their rights to an adequate standard of living, clean water, and health. We are also calling for effective remedy for people whose rights have long been abused.\\\"\\n\\nObserving that \\\"Shell is not uniquely responsible for the devastating oil pollution that blight the Niger Delta,\\\" Dummett said other actors in the devastation include, federal and state authorities, adding that \\\"They too have the obligation to ensure that Shell's divestment does not lead to further human rights harm. \\\"\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"allafrica.com\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"allAfrica\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn08.allafrica.com\\/static\\/images\\/structure\\/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":-0.05098039215686279, \"wgt\":467555101, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380484095\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:25:01\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:25:01Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:42Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/jerseyeveningpost.com\\/morenews\\/uknews\\/2024\\/10\\/25\\/residents-at-care-home-where-three-people-died-felt-safe-according-to-report\\/\", \"title\":\"Residents at care home where three people died 'felt safe', according to report\", \"body\":\"Family members and residents of a care home where three people died of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning previously told inspectors that the staff were \\\"very safety conscious\\\", according to reports by the healthcare watchdog.\\n\\nDorset Police received a report at 7:16am on Wednesday regarding three residents - two men, aged 74 and 91, and an 86-year-old woman - who were found dead at Gainsborough Care Home in Ulwell Road, Swanage.\\n\\nSeven people were taken to hospital as a precaution and were not in a serious condition, the force has said.\\n\\nThe deaths are being treated as unexplained and detectives are still exploring possible carbon monoxide poisoning as the primary line of inquiry.

A 32-year-old woman named Alexandra Pennig had been found dead in her bathroom with a single gunshot wound to the head.\\n\\nFor the detectives, what really happened to Pennig is something that still haunts them to this day. And it's the question at the center of \\\"The Strange Shooting of Alex Pennig,\\\" reported by \\\"48 Hours\\\" contributor Natalie Morales airing Saturday, Oct. 26 at 10\\/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.\\n\\nWhen detectives DeSanto and O'Donnell arrived at the apartment, they found out Pennig had not been alone at the time of her death. A man named Matthew Ecker was also there. Ecker and Pennig were both nurses and had met two years earlier when they worked at the same clinic. Ecker told first responders the gun was his, and that Pennig had grabbed it, locked herself in the bathroom, and then fired the shot. \\\"I thought everything was fine,\\\" he said. \\\"And then she just grabbed the gun.\\\" Ecker told first responders that after he heard the shot he immediately broke open the bathroom door: \\\"I tried to do what I could. And then I washed my hands ... That's why I don't have anything on my hands.\\\" Ecker said he then called 911. But it was too late. He said he didn't know why Pennig would do this.\\n\\nIn Pennig's apartment, there was alcohol and six bottles of prescription medication, including antidepressants, all prescribed to Pennig. For the detectives, it suggested Alex might have been depressed, and they wondered if Ecker's story that she took her own life was true.\\n\\nBut they also noticed something that seemed to contradict Ecker's story. He had said he washed his hands in the bathroom sink before calling 911, but DeSanto recalled the first responders told her the sink was dry. \\\"The sink was dry. If he had said, you know, he called the police right away, that sink probably would've been still wet,\\\" DeSanto explained, \\\"but it was very dry in there.\\\"\\n\\nWhen O'Donnell looked into Pennig's background, she learned from Alex's parents that Alex had struggled in the past with depression and addiction. \\\"I had asked, um, if she had been suicidal in the past, um, and dad said, she had, um, tried, uh, to overdose before,\\\" said O'Donnell. According to Alex's father, Jim Pennig, several years prior, Alex had taken a handful of pills \\\"and then had told her mom that she was attempting suicide.\\\" After that, Alex's parents told the detectives they sent her to rehab, and she eventually got clean. Despite her past struggles, Alex's parents told O'Donnell they had just seen her at Thanksgiving. And her mom, Mary Jo Pennig, had just talked to her that evening. \\\"She was doing well,\\\" she said. For them, the idea that their daughter had died by suicide did not make sense. \\\"Knowing your kid, it didn't fit,\\\" Mary Jo Pennig said.\\n\\nSince Ecker was the last person to see Alex Pennig alive, the detectives zeroed in on him. \\\"He's the only one that can tell us what happened. He was the only one that was there,\\\" said O'Donnell. They questioned Ecker about what had happened that night. He said he and Alex Pennig had gone out to several local bars, and when they arrived back at her place, everything was fine: \\\"We were laughing on the way home,\\\" said Ecker. DeSanto asked him if, once they got into the apartment, they had gotten into a fight. Ecker said they did not.\\n\\nDET. ABBY DESANTO: You guys weren't arguing or anything?\\n\\nMATTHEW ECKER: No.\\n\\nDET. ABBY DESANTO: There's no fight with you two?\\n\\nMATTHEW ECKER: Not between us.\\n\\nFor hours, Ecker continued to say Pennig had locked herself in the bathroom, fired the shot and then he broke open the door to try and help her: \\\"That gun went off behind a closed door ... I did not shoot her.\\\"\\n\\nBut the detectives had their doubts. Then they got a call from the forensic unit that was still processing the scene. And according to O'Donnell, what they found changed everything. \\\"Once Alex was moved, they found underneath where Alex had been laying was a round metal piece,\\\" she said. \\\"It was the shape of a ring, and about the size of a quarter.\\\" O'Donnell said it was part of the lock from the bathroom door, and the fact that it had been discovered under Pennig was key. \\\"For us, it meant that the door was forced open before she was shot.\\\"\\n\\nThe detectives felt the discovery of the metal ring proved Ecker had lied and had not broken the door open after he heard the shot. The detectives suspected Pennig and Ecker had argued and that she had locked the bathroom door to get away from him. Then Ecker broke open the door, the metal part broke off and fell to the ground, and then he shot Pennig and she landed on top of it.\\n\\nEcker was charged with second-degree murder. In February 2024 he was convicted and later sentenced to 30 years. He is appealing his conviction.\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"dnyuz.com\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"DNyuz\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"https:\\/\\/dnyuz.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/10\\/How-a-small-piece-of-a-bathroom-door-lock-helped.jpg\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":-0.2941176470588235, \"wgt\":467555075, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380483383\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":true, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:24:34\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:34Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:13Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.waterford-news.ie\\/poll-are-you-fed-up-of-the-clocks-going-back_arid-36074.html\", \"title\":\"Poll: Are you fed up of the clocks going back? - Homepage - Waterford News & Star\", \"body\":\"With the looming eventuality of the clocks going back on Sunday, resistance to the practice has resurfaced.\\n\\nEvery year the clocks go back an hour at 2am on the last Sunday of October, seeing Ireland's time zone switch from Irish Summer Time to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).\\n\\nSe\\u00e1n Kelly, Fine Gael MEP for Ireland South, said the clock changes are an \\\"outdated practice\\\" that have negative effects on health, well-being, and safety.\\n\\nSo, if you had your way, would the clock changes stay or go?

United's defensive porousness means Onana has been kept far busier than he would like since his arrival at the club. No goalkeeper has faced more shots in the last two Premier League seasons. But his saves have often kept their heads above water.\\n\\nAccording to Opta's expected goal model, Onana is third among goalkeepers, behind only Arijanet Muric and Emiliano Martinez, for expected goals prevented since the start of last term, his saves worth a whopping 7.14 goals, based on the quality of chances faced.\\n\\nOf course, it is his errors, mostly concentrated in his first few months at the club, which stick in the memory. Perceptions were shaped early among Premier League viewers. But his value has become clear to United fans and a broader reassessment is probably overdue.\\n\\nThere were of course costly mistakes in the Champions League last year. In the Premier League, though, Onana has only made two errors leading to shots in 46 games, according to Opta. It is half as many as Alisson and three fewer than Martinez since the start of last season.\\n\\nHis occasional mis-steps continue to be pounced upon by critics. But his heroics on Thursday night were just the latest reminder that United would be worse off without him.\\n\\nArsenal's injury issues, coupled with unconvincing displays against Bournemouth and Shakhtar Donetsk, have added to the clamour for teenager Ethan Nwaneri to be given more chances. Mikel Arteta's perceived reluctance has prompted criticism from some fans.\\n\\nWatching his cameos this season, it is easy to understand the desire to see more of him. Nwaneri, characterised by driving runs and smooth footwork, is clearly a thrilling prospect. Inside the club, he is seen as having the humility and work ethic to match his talent.\\n\\nCould Arteta have made more use of him against Bournemouth and Shakhtar? Probably. Arsenal looked clunky at the Vitality Stadium even before William Saliba's red card. Nwaneri is probably the closest thing Arteta has in his squad to a Martin Odegaard alternative.\\n\\nBut it still feels harsh to criticise the manager who made him the youngest player in Premier League history, aged 15 years and 181 against Brentford in 2022, over a lack of opportunity.\\n\\nArteta said that historic appearance at the Gtech Community Stadium was motivated by \\\"gut instinct\\\" at the time. In truth, it was more calculated than he let on; an attempt to show the club's most prodigiously talented academy player a pathway to the first-team.\\n\\nInevitably, though, it also thrust him into the consciousness of supporters who, two years on, have only seen him make a further five competitive appearances at senior level.\\n\\nIt may not feel like much but it is important to remember Nwaneri only became old enough to sign a professional contract in March and is still five months from his 18th birthday. He is the second-youngest of 440 players to have played in the Premier League this season.\\n\\nIt is worth noting, too, that Nwaneri is ahead of others of comparative potential. His total of five Premier League appearances already matches that of Manchester City's Phil Foden at 18. Bukayo Saka, his fellow Arsenal academy graduate, did not reach the same milestone until a month after turning 18.\\n\\nThere is, perhaps, a broader question to be asked about Arteta's use of academy players. Saka is the only one who makes their strongest team now. But that scarcity is a natural consequence of rising standards. Arsenal have gone from top-four hopefuls to title challengers under his management.\\n\\nIt is a testament to Nwaneri's ability that he already looks capable of stepping up. But over-exposure at such a young age brings risks. And besides, at 17, it is more accurate to say he is ahead of schedule than being held back by his manager. His time will come.\\n\\nAlexander Isak's 21 Premier League goals last season put him behind only Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer but he goes into Newcastle's meeting with Chelsea, live on Sky Sports on Sunday, having only found the net once in six games. He does not look himself.\\n\\nThe 25-year-old has been hindered by a broken toe, admittedly, missing three games before Saturday's 1-0 loss to Brighton. But his one-on-one effort saved by Bart Verbruggen, one of seven shots without scoring in the game, seemed to sum up his recent struggles.\\n\\nIn total, it is one goal from 18 shots this season. A conversion rate which stood at 27 per cent last season, and 20 per cent the year before that, has fallen to only six per cent this term.\\n\\nIt should be noted, however, that, according to Opta's expected goals model, that one-on-one chance against Brighton was one of only two high-value opportunities he has had all season.\\n\\nHe converted the other, from Jacob Murphy's pass across goal to clinch the 2-1 win over Tottenham in September. Otherwise, though, he has been limited to low-quality chances, his average of 0.42 non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes down from 0.62 last season.\\n\\nIt is of course partly the responsibility of a striker to generate scoring chances. Isak has so far lacked his usual sharpness. But the responsibility for his scoring struggles should be shared. Better service is needed to return to the heights of last season.\\n\\nEverton's Iliman Ndiaye has been fun to watch this season.

The result isn't just an epic fantasy show with a grand scope, but one that homes in on the intimate personal stakes.\\n\\n[Ed. note: This review contains spoilers for The Legend of Vox Machina season 3.]\\n\\nThe third season of The Legend of Vox Machina picks up right where the last one left off: Raishan (Cree Summer), one of the dragons in the group bent on taking over the world, reaches out to the adventuring party and offers them intel on a magical item that could stop the tyrannical dragon leader.\\n\\nBut, predictably, the adventurers of Vox Machina have a lot going on in this season, and not just when it comes to defeating the big bad dragon. Bard Scanlan (Sam Riegel), for instance, wishes to repair the relationship he has with his estranged daughter. Druid Keyleth (Marisha Ray) and rogue Vax (Liam O'Brien) dance around a romantic relationship while facing their own internal battles, as do Vex (Laura Bailey) and Percy (Taliesin Jaffe). Pike (Ashley Johnson) grapples with her faith, and barbarian Grog (Travis Willingham)... well, Grog's actually pretty peachy this season. There's world and lore to expand and minor character backstories to flesh out, and still, even with all of that in 12 half-hour episodes, the show doesn't actually feel like it's taking on too much.\\n\\nIt's because the creators know when to slow down. Improvised banter is built into the original campaign, but it proves to be a valuable asset in figuring out when to let the emotional beats sit for a moment. The characters may be facing increasing stakes and bigger foes, but they're also feeling the effects of those things.\\n\\nFor the audience, this is incredibly valuable. These days, a lot of high-stakes shows don't bother to really drill in on the downtime or the moments between big world-ending plot points. Eight hour-long episodes go by in a breathless blur. But The Legend of Vox Machina checks in with the characters, how they're feeling about themselves, their mission, and each other. Even with everything happening, they're not on all the time. There's a whole bit where they take a moment to rest and recover in Scanlan's fabulous dream mansion, for instance, and it's a chance for them to hit pause and reflect. And some of the best decisions the creative team makes are in integrating more of these moments that weren't in the original campaign.\\n\\nCase in point: Percy's death. In the tabletop session, he was dead for a bit, but quickly revived. And for a D&D game with friends, that makes sense, since you want to keep the game going. But for a television show, having an easy resurrection would turn a big consequential moment into just a handwave. Dr. Anna Ripley (Kelly Hu) would be easy to dismiss as a threat, and there wouldn't be a chance for the rest of the characters to reflect. Ultimately, Percy does come back (in a different way, with new ramifications), but turning it into a few-episode-long arc really just emphasizes the personal stakes in a way that this show does very well.\\n\\nThe writers and directors have a daunting task with this show: Adapt hours and hours (and hours) of actual play into 12 half-hour episodes. The fact that they've so smartly zeroed in on what's important to the characters and the story is impressive, as is the fact that they know when to change those beats and make them fit within the structure of television. Letting Percy's death sit longer allows for the other characters -- particularly Vex -- to really reexamine their own priorities, while also heightening the fact that characters can and will die if they don't defeat the big bad.\\n\\nIt's not that The Legend of Vox Machina has more episodes or run time to fill these emotional beats in than other fantasy shows; it's that the creators know to give them just as much weight as the epic battles and big villain showdowns. The action sequences are certainly fun and intense, but they're not dragged on or given more precedence than quiet moments watching a sunrise. The allure of Critical Role has always been the characters (and the actors behind them), and that focus on the small stakes as well as the large ones is what levels up The Legend of Vox Machina. And in the third season, when so much is happening, yet there's still space for that muchness to breathe, it's more evident than ever that this show is something special.\", \"source\":{\"uri\":\"dnyuz.com\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"title\":\"DNyuz\"}, \"authors\":[], \"image\":\"https:\\/\\/dnyuz.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/10\\/In-a-world-without-filler-episodes-The-Legend-of-Vox.jpg\", \"eventUri\":null, \"sentiment\":0.192156862745098, \"wgt\":467555074, \"relevance\":1}, {\"uri\":\"8380482641\", \"lang\":\"eng\", \"isDuplicate\":false, \"date\":\"2024-10-25\", \"time\":\"12:24:33\", \"dateTime\":\"2024-10-25T12:24:33Z\", \"dateTimePub\":\"2024-10-25T12:23:36Z\", \"dataType\":\"news\", \"sim\":0, \"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.dailymail.co.uk\\/health\\/article-14001391\\/Davina-McCall-menopause-HRT-hack.html\", \"title\":\"Davina McCall's menopause GP reveals genius hack to reduce HRT risk\", \"body\":\"Davina McCall's menopause doctor has revealed a surprising hack that tackles a little-known risk of using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) drugs.\\n\\nDr Naomi Potter, who co-wrote the 2022 book 'Menopausing' with Ms McCall, shared the tip on how to stop the hands becoming contaminated gel forms of the medicine.\\n\\nIn a video on Instagram Dr Potter, who is a British Menopause Society specialist, describes 'a hands-free' method of applying oestrogen gel, which she says is 'the best way'.\\n\\nHRT, which mimics the hormones that drop naturally in a woman's body as a consequence of the menopause, is used by almost two million women in the UK.\\n\\nGels contain the female hormone oestrogen which is absorbed through the skin, typically applied to the arms, thighs, abdomen or buttocks.\\n\\nBut after applying it, traces of the gel may remain to the hands which can then be transferred to a partner or child, or even a pet, when a woman touches them.\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\nA post shared by Dr Naomi Potter | Menopause Doctor (@dr_naomipotter)\\n\\nDr Naomi Potter (right), a British Menopause Society accredited hormone specialist who has worked with celebrities like Davina McCall (left)on menopause awareness, shared a trick on how to stop your hands becoming contaminated with HRT drugs\\n\\nFor this reason, women who use the gel are advised to wash their hands thoroughly after applying the drug.\\n\\nWhile the risk is extremely small, exposing children and men to excess oestrogen could theoretically trigger problems, such as excess breast tissue growth.\\n\\nDr Potter shared the neat hack she says he learned from her own patients on how to avoid this risk entirely.\\n\\n'Most commonly women push the pump dispenser down onto their hand and rub it in,' she said in the clip which has been viewed more than 50,000 times.\\n\\nRead More Fury at viral food guru Eddie Abbew for claiming perimenopause is 'BS' and can be reversed with diet\\n\\nHowever, Dr Potter added: 'One way you can avoid the contamination on your hand is simply by using the top of the Oestrogel [brand of gel] bottle.'\\n\\n'You put your dispense dose down on the top of the bottle and then you can apply it.\\n\\n'Then let it dry, and your hands are left completely uncontaminated by the additional oestrogen.'\\n\\nHRT can come in tablets, patches, gels and sprays and several high-profile celebrities, including Penny Lancaster and Ms McCall have spoken about how the drugs have transformed their lives.\\n\\nAccording to the NHS, the risk of developing serious side-effects on HRT are 'very low', although it can lead to a small increase in breast cancer risk.\\n\\nMenopause occurs when a woman stops having periods and is no longer able to get pregnant naturally.\\n\\nIt is a normal part of ageing and is marked by levels of the sex hormone oestrogen dropping.\\n\\nIt typically starts between the age of 45 and 55 for most women.\\n\\nHowever, it can occur earlier, naturally for a minority of women, and as a result of other health problems and treatments, like those for cancer.\\n\\nSome women go through this time with few, if any, symptoms.

The film, directed by Shashanka Chaturvedi, has been one of the most anticipated OTT releases of the year. Kriti, in a bold dual-role performance as twin sisters Shailee and Saumya, impressed viewers with her skill at portraying contrasting personalities. Shaheer Sheikh also received praise for his role, while Kajol brought her signature intensity to the screen. However, despite the film's star power, it seems to be struggling to resonate due to a weak screenplay and a storyline that left fans wanting more.\\n\\nDo Patti follows the story of twin sisters, Shailee and Saumya, who find themselves entangled in a web of suspense and unexpected revelations. The thriller promises an intense exploration of familial bonds against a backdrop of mounting tension and hidden truths.\\n\\nWhile Kriti's fans flooded social media with praise for her dual role execution, feedback about the overall movie has been less forgiving. Twitter users, for instance, have voiced concerns about the storytelling, citing issues with direction and depth of characters. One viewer remarked, \\\"#DoPatti is as flat as it can get. Kajol, Kriti, and Shaheer are sincere in their roles, but the fault lies with the writing and direction. The characters lack depth and are so unconvincing.\\\"\\n\\nThis lack of depth, coupled with an underwhelming storyline, seems to be the main criticism for Do Patti. The suspense elements appear diluted by a script that doesn't quite pull the audience into its web as effectively as hoped.\\n\\nDespite the movie's flaws, Kriti Sanon's portrayal of the twins is being hailed as one of the best performances of her career. One fan tweeted, \\\"Kriti! The way you portrayed Shailee and Saumya was effortless. You pulled off such contrasting personalities with such ease. Just too good! Shailee & Saumya are going to be one of the most memorable characters.\\\"\\n\\nDo patti movie review - Engaging and interesting first half. The second half is disturbing.

New ERA was made possible by President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which makes the largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936.\\n\\nNew ERA program funding is available to member-owned rural electric cooperatives, which have been the backbone of America's rural power delivery for nearly a century. Today's investment in rural co-ops will create good-paying jobs and make energy more affordable for families in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, Minnesota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming.\\n\\n\\\"Since day one of his administration, President Biden has remained committed to ensuring rural communities are directly benefitting from a clean energy economy,\\\" Secretary Vilsack said. \\\"Through today's announcement, USDA is delivering on this commitment with critical funding from the President's historic Inflation Reduction Act. These projects will strengthen America's energy security while increasing access to affordable and reliable clean energy for people across the nation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Inflation Reduction Act makes the largest investment in rural electrification since FDR and the New Deal in the 1930s,\\\" said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. \\\"Today's awards will bring clean, affordable, reliable power to rural Americans from Colorado to Texas to South Carolina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All across America, rural electric cooperatives play an important role in delivering reliable sources of energy to rural communities. Under President Biden and Vice President Harris's leadership, we are making significant investments to ensure that those communities are receiving clean, carbon-free energy - which will reduce the pollution in our air and water, create good-paying jobs, and lower families' home energy costs,\\\" said White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. \\\"By helping rural cooperatives upgrade infrastructure and invest in newer, lower cost clean electricity projects, these investments will benefit rural families and businesses who for too long have faced disproportionately high energy costs due to the challenges of providing electricity in remote communities.\\\"\\n\\nToday in Westminster, Colorado, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Torres Small joined the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association to highlight the benefits of the nearly $2.5 billion in financing, made possible by a combination of grants and loans through the program. Tri-State's award is expected to reduce electricity rates 10 percent for cooperative members by 2034, amassing $430 million in rural consumer benefits over ten years. New ERA funds will finance the purchase of 1,040 megawatts of renewable energy and more than 200 megawatts of energy storage. New ERA funds will also help Tri-State refinance the retirement of 1,100 megawatts of previously and newly announced coal-fired energy generation. The investments will provide affordable, reliable, and resilient energy to Tri-State's cooperative members across Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Wyoming. This investment will reduce climate pollution by nearly 5.8 million tons annually. This transformative investment is expected to create more than 2,000 jobs.\\n\\nUSDA also announced six electric cooperatives to move forward in the New ERA process. The six cooperatives are:\\n\\nUSDA will be investing nearly $1 billion in grants and loans for these six new selectees, which will leverage investments of $6.4 billion for 1.75 gigawatts of clean energy for rural communities across the country. The selectees announced today will reduce and avoid at least 6.4 million tons of greenhouse gases annually.\\n\\nIncluding today's announcements, USDA has announced over $8.3 billion in funding as part of the New ERA program to benefit rural electric cooperatives and their members through the New ERA program. USDA expects this over $8.3 billion to result in over $13 billion in New ERA financed grants and loans. These projects will create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for rural communities, significantly reduce pollution, enhance the resiliency of the nation's electric grid, and advance the Biden-Harris Administration's Justice40 Initiative. One in five rural Americans will benefit from these clean energy investments.\\n\\nFarmer Benefit Plan\\n\\nUSDA also announced the release of a Farmer Benefit Plan as an innovative way for New ERA awardees to demonstrate ways for agricultural producers to benefit from clean energy projects. USDA encourages each award recipient to collaborate with local stakeholders to develop a Community Benefit Plan. During the first year of the award, applicants will collaborate with their communities and local farm associations to codevelop a plan. Based on the New ERA applications received so far, coops are collaborating with 154 local community groups, including 50 farm organizations, to explore local priorities.\\n\\nAs part of their New ERA award, Tri-State will develop a Farmer Benefit Plan that aims to lower electricity costs for farmers who voluntarily participate in a smart irrigation program. The goal of the program is to reduce pumping load at the times of peak demand. This will help reduce future energy needs and offset the need to build new transmission and generation, saving cooperative members from future costs. Tri-State will work with farmers to execute additional energy programs to encourage the most efficient use of electricity and water and will provide no-cost technical support to enable participation in these opportunities.

These results, combined with those from the ADORING 1 and ADORING 2 pivotal studies, demonstrate VTAMA cream's potential ability to not only effectively and safely treat patients as young as 2 years of age with atopic dermatitis, but may also enable a majority to achieve complete disease clearance, and maintain either clear or almost clear skin for an average of over 2 and a half months while off all treatment.\\\"\\n\\nADORING 1 and ADORING 2 were two identical, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of VTAMA cream, 1% in adults and pediatric patients as young as 2 years old with AD who had a Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 3 (moderate) to 4 (severe) at baseline. ADORING 3, a 48-week open-label, long-term extension (LTE) study, enrolled eligible patients from ADORING 1, ADORING 2, a 4-week maximal usage pharmacokinetics study, and VTAMA cream-naive patients aged 2-17 years with either mild, moderate or severe AD that did not meet inclusion in ADORING 1 and ADORING 2.\\n\\nIn ADORING 3, patients were followed for up to 48 weeks, with safety and tolerability endpoints that included treatment emergent adverse events, adverse events of special interest, investigator-assessed and patient\\/caregiver-assessed local tolerability, and efficacy endpoints that included the achievement of complete disease clearance (vIGA-AD=0), and the achievement of clear or almost clear skin (vIGA-AD=0 or 1). Patients entering with any disease activity (vIGA-AD\\u22651) were treated with VTAMA cream, 1% until complete disease clearance was achieved (vIGA-AD=0). Those entering with or achieving complete clearance (vIGA-AD=0) discontinued VTAMA cream, 1% and were followed to measure the treatment-free interval, defined as the maintenance of clear or almost clear skin (vIGA-AD=0 or 1) for consecutive days while no longer receiving any treatment for AD. Patients whose AD returned to mild or above (vIGA-AD\\u22652) were re-treated until complete disease clearance (vIGA-AD=0) was achieved again. ADORING 3 reinforced the safety and tolerability of VTAMA cream, 1% demonstrated in ADORING 1 and ADORING 2.\\n\\nADORING 3 LTE Skin Clearance and Other Results:\\n\\n728 patients enrolled in ADORING 3; of which 83.0% were pediatric patients (2-17 years) proportionally balanced across defined pediatric age groups. Overall, 51.9% (378\\/728) of patients entered with or achieved complete disease clearance (vIGA-AD=0) at least once during the 48-week study, while 81.6% (594\\/728) entered with or achieved clear or almost clear skin (vIGA-AD=0 or 1) at least once during the 48-week study. After entering with or first achieving complete disease clearance and discontinuing VTAMA cream, 1% treatment (n=378), the average duration of the first treatment-free interval was 79.8 consecutive days (with a standard deviation of 81.4 days). After achieving vIGA-AD=0 and discontinuing VTAMA cream, 1%, patients whose vIGA-AD returned to \\u22652 (mild or above) off-treatment could regain vIGA-AD=0 when re-treated. No evidence of tachyphylaxis (loss of response) in patients receiving either continuous or intermittent therapy of VTAMA cream, 1% was observed for up to 48 weeks. Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate; the most frequent were folliculitis (12.1%), nasopharyngitis (6.9%), and upper respiratory tract infection (6.9%). Study discontinue rate due to TEAEs were low (2.6%). Adverse events of special interest (AESI), follicular events, contact dermatitis, and headache were mostly mild or moderate and associated with low study discontinuation rates (1.0%, 0.4%, and 0% respectively). There was no study discontinuation due to headache. VTAMA cream, 1% was well tolerated, even when applied to affected sensitive skin areas, including the face (n=374) and neck (n=398).\\n\\nVTAMA cream, 1% is a novel, aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist in development in the U.S. as a once-daily, cosmetically elegant, and steroid-free, topical cream for both acute treatment and long-term management of AD. VTAMA cream, 1% is currently approved for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults in the U.S. In April 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the company's Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for VTAMA\\u00ae (tapinarof) cream, 1% for the topical treatment of AD in adults and children 2 years of age and older.

AD occurs most frequently in children, affecting up to 20% worldwide. The disease results in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin, often affecting the folds of the arms, back of the knees, hands, face, and neck. Itching is an especially bothersome symptom in AD, and tends to worsen at night, disturbing sleep and causing fatigue, which in children can lead to inattention at school. People with AD may also experience social and emotional distress due to the visibility and discomfort of the disease.\\n\\nAbout Dermavant\\n\\nDermavant Sciences, a subsidiary of Roivant Sciences, is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics in immuno-dermatology.

It has filed for bankruptcy and renounced its status as a professional sports club. On Nov. 5, more than 80 people will lose their jobs in a 6 million euros ($6.5 million) redundancy plan. Without a new investor in sight one of France\\'s proudest clubs faces a race against time to avoid liquidation.\\n\\n\"You feel so sad, disillusioned,\" said Alain Giresse, a club legend who scored 182 goals in 592 appearances in the 1970\\'s and \\'80s. \"It\\'s not a club that destroyed itself, it\\'s a club that has been destroyed (by) the people in charge.\"\\n\\nThe team now plays in the National 2 league -- three rungs below France\\'s top tier -- against opponents from towns with as few as 10,000 residents. By contrast, Bordeaux, a tourist destination world-renowned for its prestigious wines, counts about 1 million people in its metropolitan area.\\n\\nIf that\\'s an unfamiliar situation for the club, the same can be said for its top player, former England and Liverpool striker Andy Carroll, who joined Bordeaux this summer.\\n\\n\"I knew the situation they were in and when I spoke to them, I knew there was a project there,\" Carroll, 35, told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \"It\\'s a club that deserves to be at the top with the stadium, the training ground, the fans, everything that the club has to give.\"\\n\\nBordeaux\\'s misfortune shows how a longtime top-level club can plummet through the league system of European soccer, which unlike U.S. professional sports operates on a system of promotion and relegation whereby teams at the bottom of a league drop down a level the following season.\\n\\nFounded in 1936, FC Girondins de Bordeaux has played a total of 75 seasons in France\\'s top division and won its latest league title in 2009. It has also won four French cups, three League Cups and reached the 1996 UEFA Cup final.\\n\\nThe club\\'s training ground is named after the 19th century Château du Haillan, which sits at the heart of its sweeping meadows, befitting the aesthetic aura of a club graced by elegant playmakers like Giresse, Zidane and Yoann Gourcuff. In 2010, Haillan buzzed with anticipation when a Gourcuff-inspired Bordeaux reached the Champions League quarterfinals.\\n\\nNow almost every training pitch is empty.\\n\\n\"It\\'s like a place that no is longer alive, there\\'s nothing there,\" Giresse told AP by telephone.\\n\\nAfter the resolution of a dispute over matchday costs with the owners, Bordeaux has returned to the 42,000-capacity Matmut Atlantique stadium, which hosted soccer matches during the Paris Olympics. But the remote location, 40 minutes from the center by tram, adds to the impression of an isolated white elephant. During a league game on Oct. 19 against Avranches, a Normandy team, the food stalls were shut and fans sat on benches eating their own provisions like a surreal picnic.\\n\\nDenis Barbet, who has followed Bordeaux since the \\'80s, was deeply upset by the youth academy\\'s closure.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a catastrophe with all the people who lost their jobs,\" Barbet, 57, said. \"The training center is emblematic of the club, the Château du Haillan is exceptional. When you\\'ve known that and the glory days, and now there\\'s nothing left and everything\\'s been abandoned, it\\'s heart-breaking.\"\\n\\nHis son, Yoann Barbet, came through the academy and captained Bordeaux last season when it finished 12th in division two.\\n\\nAs another lifelong fan, Regis Marty used to watch Giresse and Zidane in the glory days and fears a bleak future.\\n\\n\"There are not many solutions other than a good buyer,\" Marty, 61, said. \"I don\\'t believe it will happen. I want it with all my heart, but it will be difficult.\"\\n\\nDuring the game, the club\\'s main supporter groups, Ultramarines and North Gate, expressed differing views about the club\\'s leadership.\\n\\nWhile the Ultramarines unfurled a giant banner talking about \"renewed hope\" the North Gate urged club president Gérard Lopez to \"get lost\" and let off flares with black smoke in protest.\\n\\nBordeaux won 1-0 with Carroll\\'s fifth goal in three matches.\\n\\n\"Right now I\\'m running around out there every day feeling like I\\'m still 17,\" Carroll said. \"I feel really good in myself and in my life, in football and outside the club.\"\\n\\nCarroll\\'s heading ability and remarkable chest-trapping of the ball set him apart in amateur soccer. Hardly surprising, considering he played 16 seasons in the Premier League and scored twice for England.\\n\\nCarroll cost Liverpool 35 million pounds ($46 million) when he joined from Newcastle in January 2011. Back then, he was the Premier League\\'s most expensive British transfer signing.\\n\\nAfter years with injury problems, he joined French second-division team Amiens last season and moved to Bordeaux this year. His salary is undisclosed, but the maximum monthly wage in the amateur league is 3,500 euros ($3,800).\\n\\n\"When I first came here, I wanted to challenge myself, something different,\" Carroll said. \"I didn\\'t know how it was going to be.\"\\n\\nHe has experienced deafening atmospheres at St. James\\' Park in Newcastle and Anfield in Liverpool. So what does he think about playing away against Saumur in a 2,500-capacity stadium?\\n\\n\"I love it, think it\\'s brilliant. That\\'s what grassroots football is about, that\\'s where I started and it just brings back a lot of memories,\" Carroll said. \"It\\'s just a great feeling just to play football and still have the fans there at my age. It doesn\\'t matter if there\\'s just a rope around the pitch or a big stadium.\"\\n\\nGeneral American Capital Partners bought Bordeaux from long-term owner M6 television channel in 2018, then sold it to backer King Street.\\n\\nThe pandemic and a collapsed television deal caused French soccer huge losses. When King Street pulled out, Lopez acquired Bordeaux in June 2021. The following season it finished last in Ligue 1 and was relegated.\\n\\nAs Bordeaux narrowly missed out on moving back up the next year, Lopez offset huge financial losses by writing a shareholder\\'s loan to Bordeaux for 38 million euros.\\n\\nAhead of this season, the club failed to provide financial guarantees to French soccer\\'s financial watchdog, the DNCG. After a deal with potential backers The Fenway Sports Group -- which owns Liverpool and the Boston Red Sox -- fell through, the DNCG demoted Bordeaux to the third tier in July. Bordeaux was placed into receivership by the city\\'s commercial court, which triggered another relegation but at least meant a debt freeze.\\n\\nFifty academy players were released, generating short-term savings but depriving the club of future revenue from selling homegrown talent.\\n\\nFormer players like Giresse, Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, want Lopez out. So does city mayor Pierre Hurmic. Going into liquidation could enforce that, but Bordeaux would drop into the abyss of regional leagues.\\n\\nLopez didn\\'t respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nBordeaux, at mid-table early in the season, needs two promotions to return to professional soccer so therefore plenty of goals from Carroll, who is optimistic despite the scale of the challenge.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a massive pressure on us anyway, being who we are, to get promoted,\" Carroll said. \"If we can carry on winning games I think the pressure\\'s going to be on the other teams to stop us.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'hosted.ap.org', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Associated Press'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'summary_large_image', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.06666666666666665, 'wgt': 467555115, 'relevance': 1}, {'uri': '8380484564', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-25', 'time': '12:25:15', 'dateTime': '2024-10-25T12:25:15Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-25T12:24:59Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://triblive.com/news/world/hungarys-orban-claims-polands-center-right-government-was-installed-by-the-eu/', 'title': \"Hungary's Orbán claims Poland's center-right government was installed by the EU\", 'body': 'BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán suggested on Friday that Poland\\'s government and its prime minister, Donald Tusk, were installed by the European Union as part of a plot to remove the country\\'s previous right-wing populist leadership.\\n\\nOrbán provided no evidence to substantiate his claims about Poland\\'s government, which was elected in 2023 with record high voter turnout of nearly 74%.\\n\\nThe comments came two days after Orbán, a nationalist who has taken an increasingly adversarial approach to the EU, told supporters in a speech that the bloc seeks to topple his government and install a puppet regime in Hungary.\\n\\nSpeaking to state radio Friday, Orbán lashed out at EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and the leader of the bloc\\'s largest political group, European People\\'s Party president Manfred Weber, claiming they were seeking to replace his government as he said they had in Poland in 2023, when a coalition led by Tusk defeated the governing Law and Justice party in national elections.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not even a secret conspiracy against Hungary, it is an openly represented, announced plan,\" Orbán said of the alleged plot against him, for which he has not provided evidence. \"The same thing happened in Poland. The Poles also went their own way, they also took an independent Polish policy on migration, gender and the economy.\"\\n\\nVon der Leyen and Weber, he continued, \"did their best and openly announced that the conservative Polish government should go and be replaced with a new one. This is how our friend Tusk became prime minister in Poland. The same scenario is now happening in the case of Hungary.\"\\n\\nIn a text message to The Associated Press, a spokesman for Poland\\'s Foreign Ministry, Pawel Wroński, said: \"A free parliamentary election took place in Poland on Oct. 15, 2023. The current government in Poland, just like the previous governments, was not installed but has been elected and is the expression of the will of the Polish voters.\"\\n\\nOrbán has frequently clashed with the EU, which has withheld billions in financial support from Hungary over its alleged breaches of rule-of-law and democracy standards. Poland\\'s previous nationalist-conservative government also spent years wrangling with the EU over democratic deficiencies.\\n\\nIn response, Orbán has taken an increasingly combative approach to the bloc, which Hungary joined in 2004, and rallied euro-skeptic parties across the EU to create a far-right political force in the bloc\\'s legislature. He has also moved Hungary closer to autocracies like Russia and China, seeking foreign investment and loans from Moscow and Beijing as EU funds dried up over his conduct.\\n\\nTusk\\'s government has sought to restore Poland\\'s democratic institutions that he sees as having been dismantled under the previous Orbán-allied government, but has maintained some conservative policies such as a tough stance on illegal immigration.\\n\\nOrbán, who faces national elections in early 2026, compared the EU to the former Soviet Union in the interview Friday.\\n\\n\"They\\'re going to be working on this. They need a puppet government. Let\\'s speak plainly, every empire is like that.

The victory makes it three wins out of three for Ange Postecoglou\\'s side in Europe, with only Lazio and Anderlecht also possessing a 100% win rate.\\n\\nWhile Richarlison\\'s penalty secured maximum points for the Premier League side, it was Moore who was subject to significant praise from Maddison. The England star - who was captain in the absence of Son Heung-min - delivered the ultimate compliment to his teenage team-mate by comparing a portion of his second half performance to one of the game\\'s modern day greats.\\n\\n\"From minute 45 to 65 I thought we had Neymar on the left wing. He was brilliant. Just demanding the ball and fearless,\" he told TNT Sports. \"[He has] that young, fearless mentality and you never want to take that away from him.\\n\\n\"He\\'s a young kid, a brilliant lad, a lovely boy. He takes in information, and he\\'s got bags of ability, so I\\'ll be there as an older player, hopefully with some wise words to help along the way. He\\'s got all the ability. It\\'s just about knuckling down and working hard, which he does to be fair to him.\"\\n\\nPostecoglou doubled down on the praise towards Moore, describing the youngster\\'s progression as an exciting project for Spurs. \"[In the second half] we put Mikey on the left,\" the Aussie explained. \"I think he\\'s more comfortable, as you saw, playing on the left-hand side.

This is how we connect ourselves with Europe, how we enable goods to move across long distances, not to mention people. So, I believe we will find a solution to this issue, and we need to build this railway,\" he told the show.\\n\\nSvet said Latvia and Lithuania have bigger problems than Estonia, but all countries are working hard to complete the route, which stretches from Tallinn to the Polish border.\\n\\n\"Our route is set: We need to build it from the Tallinn to the Latvian border.

next year.\\n\\nThe proposals would see the supplier borrow an initial £1.5 billion from its creditors, amid concerns the company could run out of cash early next year.\\n\\nIt will then seek another £1.5 billion depending on an upcoming decision by industry regulators.\\n\\nHere the PA news agency explains why the water company needs more money and what it could mean for customers.\\n\\n- What is Thames Water?\\n\\nThames Water is the UK\\'s largest water supplier.\\n\\nThe utilities giant supplies around 16 million households across London and the South East.\\n\\nIt was formed after the privatisation of water and sewage businesses in the UK in 1989 by the Conservative government.\\n\\nThames Water supplies around 16 million households across London and the South East (Andrew Matthews/PA)\\n\\n- Who owns Thames Water?\\n\\nThames Water is owned by a group of investors, ranging from pensions funds to sovereign wealth funds.\\n\\nThe largest single owner is Canadian pension fund OMERS, which owns almost a third of the business.\\n\\nThe Universities Superannuation Scheme, a pension fund for UK academics, is the second-largest shareholder.\\n\\n- What are the company\\'s finances like?\\n\\nThe company has come under greater scrutiny in recent years because of it heavy debt burden and the pressure of this on its operations.\\n\\nThames Water was left with around £10 billion in debt when it was sold by previous owner Macquarie in 2017.\\n\\nIt currently has around £15 billion in debt, which is expected to keep increasing thanks to high debt interest costs after a recent rise in borrowing costs.\\n\\nThe company swung back to a profit in its latest financial year but has been seeking longer-term funding in order to secure its finances.\\n\\n- Why has the business proposed a new funding deal?\\n\\nThames Water has eaten significantly into its cash position over the past year as it pays off its significant debt interest and investment commitments.\\n\\nOn Friday, the company said it had only £500 million left, excluding another £500 million set aside for reserves and compensation payments.\\n\\nIn July, the company said it had £1.8 billion of liquidity, which would be enough to tide it over until May next year.\\n\\nIt has now said it would need the extra £1.5 billion in funding to keep it operating until next October, with further cash needed to help it in the long run.\\n\\nThe group is also looking at separate equity options and a potential restructuring of debt.\\n\\n53%\\n\\nHow much Thames Water requested to raise bills by for the next five years\\n\\n- What does this mean for customers?\\n\\nThe company has called for significant price increases for its customers to help bring in more revenues and help it fund its turnaround plan.\\n\\nIt most recently asked water regulator Ofwat to allow it to hike prices by 53% for the next five years.\\n\\nOfwat said earlier this year it would allow average prices across water firms to be lifted by 23% over the period.\\n\\nThere have since been reports that Ofwat could allow for a sharper rise in its final decision after pressure from water firms and their investors.\\n\\nOfwat is expected to confirm its final decision on how much companies can increase their bills by December this year.\\n\\nThames Water has said it will need to access more of its potential £3 billion of funding if Ofwat does not allow it to hike prices as much as it hopes, although it would therefore be likely to launch an appeal to the regulator.\\n\\nEnvironment Secretary Steve Reed has ruled out bringing water companies back into public ownership (Peter Byrne/PA)\\n\\n- Is Thames Water heading for emergency nationalisation?\\n\\nIt has previously been reported that the Government has worked on a plan which could allow it to effectively nationalise the water giant.\\n\\nHowever, earlier this week the Environment Secretary said nationalising water firms would cost up to £100 billion and \"not resolve the problems\" faced by customers.\\n\\nSteve Reed ruled out bringing the companies back into public ownership as he outlined an independent review into the industry following a public outcry over bills, bonuses and sewage pollution.\\n\\nThe independent review into the water industry could consider abolishing regulator Ofwat among potential measures to reform the sector.\\n\\n- What happens next for Thames?\\n\\nThames Water\\'s next key steps will both begin in December.\\n\\nIn December it is expected to receive a final decision from Ofwat over how much it can increase customer bills for the next five years.\\n\\nThis will affect how much money the company will bring in and, therefore, how financially viable its current turnaround plans will be.\\n\\nIn December, it will also start the court proceedings in order to complete the initial £1.5 billion part of its funding plan. It hopes to complete this by January next year.\\n\\nThe company has said it will continue to supply customers and run services as normal for the meantime.', 'source': {'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/25/12/wire-91280739-1729857445-770_636x382.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.0117647058823529, 'wgt': 467555107, 'relevance': 1}, {'uri': '8380484180', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-25', 'time': '12:25:07', 'dateTime': '2024-10-25T12:25:07Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-25T12:24:48Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://stupiddope.com/2024/10/sean-wotherspoon-and-fat-international-rev-up-fashion-with-limited-fatlanta-collection/', 'title': 'Sean Wotherspoon and FAT International Rev Up Fashion with Limited FATlanta Collection | stupidDOPE', 'body': 'Streetwear designer Sean Wotherspoon has teamed up once again with FAT International, delivering the highly anticipated FATlanta collection.

Benjamin Franklin. Betsy Ross. The two Founding Fathers and the seamstress of the American flag all once worshipped on the now centuries-old wooden pews of Christ Church.\\n\\nIt\\'s the site of colonial America\\'s break with the Church of England -- and where the U.S. Episcopal Church was born.\\n\\nLess than a mile south, past Independence Hall, Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church stands on the oldest parcel of land continuously owned by Black Americans. It\\'s the mother church of the nation\\'s first Black denomination.\\n\\nTwo churches, across the centuries. Generations after their birth in this nation first envisioned in Philadelphia, both churches continue to serve as the spiritual home for hundreds in the city.\\n\\nChurch members see the role of their congregation as crucial, a beacon ahead of a contentious presidential election in Pennsylvania -- the most pivotal of swing states. They also express concerns about political division that the Founding Fathers once feared could tear the nation apart.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve grown as a nation, but I think at this point, we\\'re at a standstill. We\\'re terribly divided,\" said Christ Church parishioner Jeanette Morris. A registered Republican, she previously voted for former President Donald Trump, but plans to back Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5 because of her support for reproductive rights. Morris is concerned about health issues following the repeal of Roe v. Wade.\\n\\n\"Nothing is getting done in Washington because nobody can agree on anything,\" she said after a recent service. \"I pray every Sunday that we can get past this all.\"\\n\\nToday\\'s list of divisive issues is long: from abortion and immigration to taxes, climate change and the wars abroad. It\\'s also the first presidential election since an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, an act of political violence steeped in the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.\\n\\n\"I think things have changed: Slavery is abolished. The Civil Rights Act was put in place. But still, deep down, the denizens of the United States haven\\'t really come together,\" says Keith Matthews, 61, a Mother Bethel AME parishioner. \"There\\'s still a lot of hatred and misunderstanding amongst the races.\"\\n\\nAt its infancy, the United States of America also was deeply divided. And some members of Christ Church -- from Washington to the parish rector -- seemed to be at the center of it all.\\n\\n\"What we\\'re going through right now is certainly unprecedented politically. And there\\'s a huge amount of potential instability and concern that a lot of people have in this church and the United States,\" says Zack Biro, executive director of the Christ Church Preservation Trust. \"And Christ Church is a perfect example of kind of weathering that storm.\"\\n\\nThe church was founded in 1695 by a group of Philadelphia colonists as the first parish of the Church of England in Pennsylvania. Congregants later included slaves and their owners, loyalists and patriots. They listened to sermons favoring and opposing independence.\\n\\nAnglican clergy loyal to the British king led weekly prayers for the monarch. But on July 4, 1776, Christ Church\\'s vestry crossed out the king\\'s name from the Book of Common Prayer -- a defiant act of potential treason. The book is preserved today in an underground museum, a testament to the church\\'s revolutionary spirit on Independence Day.\\n\\n\"We tend to think that the early American republic was a time of great unity, but, like today, the political culture was deeply polarized,\" says John Fea, a professor of American history at Messiah University in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nDuring the 1780s, Fea said via email, debate raged about how to apply revolutionary-era principles such as liberty or freedom to all Americans. From the pulpit, the Rev. Jacob Duché, the church\\'s rector, was seen as a moderate and led prayers as the first chaplain of the Continental Congress. But then he sided with the loyalists.\\n\\nWhen the British occupied Philadelphia in 1777, the rector wrote a letter to Washington urging him to surrender and reach a deal with the British. After the letter became public, Duché traveled to England. Pennsylvania officials later labeled him a traitor and banned his reentry. His successor, the Rev. William White, became the first presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church. He\\'s praised for keeping the unity of his congregation during times of turmoil.\\n\\nChrist Church\\'s current senior pastor is the Rev. Samantha Vincent-Alexander, the first woman to serve as rector in its more than 300-year history.\\n\\n\"The idea of what do we do in this political environment right now and how do we deal with that is an incredible challenge,\" she says. \"Most of our congregations are not a unified voting bloc. They represent different people much like at the time of the American revolution.\"\\n\\n\"We had people who were loyalists and people who supported independence, and the clergy at the time had to find a way to keep the congregation together.\"\\n\\nCongregants remain proud of Christ Church\\'s crucial role in America\\'s freedom. But they also grapple with contradictions. Some church members traded slaves and are buried in the church yard near signers of the Declaration of Independence. Franklin\\'s tomb is in the nearby Christ Church burial ground.\\n\\n\"While we\\'re very proud of our history, these people were not perfect. Sometimes we tend to think of them that way, but they weren\\'t,\" says Harvey Bartle, a congregant for more than 30 years. \"What they were doing is trying to promote democracy. ... At least they advanced the ball beyond the divine right of kings, so that the society, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, could advance the system.\"\\n\\nOne church member, Absalom Jones, attended services while enslaved to a man serving in the church leadership. Jones bought his freedom and eventually became ordained as the first Black priest of the Episcopal Church. He also went on to co-create the Free African Society of Philadelphia, which Fea says \"sought to apply the rights secured from the American Revolution to the 2,000 or so free Black men and women living in the city at the time.\"\\n\\nMethodism was the fastest growing denomination in America in the 1790s. But some Methodist Episcopal Churches still segregated Black worshippers during services to the upstairs galleries. This prompted free Black Americans to start their own congregation.\\n\\nThe African Methodist Episcopal Church has been involved in the struggle for freedom and equality from its roots.\\n\\nIts founder, the Rev. Richard Allen, was born into slavery in Philadelphia in 1760 before buying his freedom in Delaware before he was 20. He returned to the city in the 1780s and became a minister.\\n\\nAfter white leaders at a Methodist church segregated Allen, Jones and other Black worshippers to the upstairs galleries for a prayer service, the group left the church and formed what would eventually become Mother Bethel AME. The church became a place of refuge for Black people fleeing slavery along the Underground Railroad and later a major gathering point for the Civil Rights Movement.\\n\\nBy creating Mother Bethel, Allen \"carved out a space where Black people could resist ... at a time where during slavery in the Deep South, Black people could not even congregate without the presence of a white man in between them,\" says Bethel AME\\'s pastor, the Rev. Mark Tyler.\\n\\nToday, the AME Church has more than 2.5 million members and thousands of congregations in dozens of nations worldwide.\\n\\n\"Certainly, we\\'ve made progress,\" says Tyler, citing Kamala Harris\\' campaign to become the country\\'s first Black female president. But he also believes that much more needs to be done to bridge America\\'s racial inequality and he worries about the potential of another Trump presidency. The AME Church, he says, has not \"outlived its usefulness.\"\\n\\n\"The fact that we have a person who openly embraces white supremacists, who has been president once and potentially could be president again in the 21st century, is all the evidence that you need to know that we still need places for Black people to come together and organize like the Black Church,\" he says.\\n\\nDuring a recent Sunday service, Tyler encouraged his congregation to vote. Some members later reflected on America\\'s beginnings and its progress and shortcomings.\\n\\n\"Two things can be said at the same time: They were brilliant in the development of this nation. But they still carried slavery ideas, women were not allowed to vote, and that needed to be changed,\" parishioner Donna Matthews said about the Founding Fathers.\\n\\n\"Who are \\'We the people\\'? I think people need to ask themselves that,\" said Matthews, 63, who attended the service with her husband, Keith, and their young grandson, Ezekiel. \"It\\'s everyone. And it\\'s the essence of why this church was started.\"\\n\\nAt the end of the service, parishioner Tayza Hill, 25, led groups on a tour of the church\\'s museum. It preserves an original wooden pulpit used by the Rev. Allen and Black leaders including abolitionist Frederick Douglass and civil rights pioneer W.E.B. Du Bois when they addressed the congregation.\\n\\nHill says she has been hearing the same question in radio shows as the election approaches: \"Is the sun rising, or is the sun setting on democracy?\" She remains hopeful and believes the continuity of her church is vital.\\n\\n\"Seeing that there\\'s still a building that has the history and is continuously being told is important because it\\'s refusing to be erased from history,\" Hill says. \"As a nation and as a church, it\\'s really up to us to defend the rights and the respectability of those who are withheld the full opportunity of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.\"\\n\\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\\'s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

She also said HIV prevention had not been adequately integrated into national responses and remained underfunded.\\n\\n\"We are living in a world of multiple consecutive crises, which threaten the global HIV response. These include rising commodity prices, shifts in multilateralism, debt crises, poverty, and the worsening impacts of climate change,\" Ms Chikukwa said.\\n\\nShe said Lesotho was one of the few countries on track to controlling the HIV epidemic, having met the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets. However, she urged the country to focus on transforming its HIV response to ensure sustainability by 2030 and beyond. This, she said, required both political and financial commitment.\\n\\n\"The next phase of our HIV response demands that we refocus efforts on critical gaps in prevention, treatment, care, and support, particularly among specific sub-populations or geographic areas. This transformation should also ensure the integration of HIV responses into broader health and social systems while achieving more with fewer resources,\" she explained.\\n\\nShe added that it was essential to safeguard unique aspects of the response, including community-led initiatives and systems, and to address human rights and gender-related challenges.\\n\\nThe HIV and AIDS Program Manager at the Ministry of Health, Tapiwa Tarumbiswa, echoed these sentiments, outlining the ministry\\'s vision for the future. He expressed hope that, in the future, HIV and TB epidemics will no longer be considered perpetual threats.\\n\\n\"We envision a future where all people in Lesotho have access to high-quality, universal HIV and TB prevention, treatment, and care services. These services should be primarily managed and sustained using domestic resources, whether in human resources, health information systems, supply chains, laboratories, quality assurance, or financing,\" Dr Tarumbiswa said.\\n\\nHe also outlined the three main goals aligned with the national strategic and health sector plans. The first goal is to reduce new infections, aiming for zero new HIV infections in Lesotho. However, by 2028, they realistically expect to see around 2600 new infections annually.\\n\\n\"As of the end of 2023, new infections were estimated at 4800,\" he added.\\n\\nAnother target is to reduce mother-to-child transmission to less than 2 percent by 2038. Additionally, they aim to reduce new annual HIV infections to be lower than the number of HIV-related deaths. \"As of the end of 2023, the HIV mortality rate stood at 5.1 percent.\"\\n\\nThe final goal is to increase knowledge of HIV status among people living with the virus. By 2028, they aim for 98 percent of people living with HIV to know their status and be linked to treatment to reduce the chances of transmitting the virus.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Lesotho People\\'s Congress (LPC) Member of Parliament, Reverend Paul Masiu, commended Lesotho\\'s progress in reaching global HIV targets, placing the country among the few to have achieved epidemic control. However, he emphasized that the country still faced significant challenges in tackling tuberculosis (TB).\\n\\n\"Lesotho remains one of the 30 countries with the highest TB and TB/HIV burden globally. While we are close to achieving the 95-95-95 targets for HIV epidemic control, disparities remain across demographics and sub-populations. We must address these gaps to achieve full epidemic control nationwide,\" Reverend Masiu said.\\n\\nHe called for a final push of targeted interventions and a commitment to delivering a cost-effective, affordable, and sustainable response to keep the country on track.', 'source': {'uri': 'allafrica.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'allAfrica'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.04313725490196074, 'wgt': 467555106, 'relevance': 1}, {'uri': '8380484262', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-25', 'time': '12:25:06', 'dateTime': '2024-10-25T12:25:06Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-25T12:24:52Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.radiotimes.com/audio/kate-bush-new-album-stage-newsupdate/', 'title': 'Kate Bush \"very keen\" to start work on new album - but also has a disappointing update for fans', 'body': 'The Wuthering Heights singer, 66, has shied away from the limelight in recent years, last releasing a studio album in 2011, which was titled 50 Words For Snow.\\n\\nHowever, in an interview on BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme on Friday (25th October), Bush said she has \"lots of ideas\" she wants to pursue.\\n\\n\"I\\'m really looking forward to getting back into that creative space, it\\'s been a long time,\" she said.\\n\\nBush added that any new music she releases has \"got to be different\", just as all of her previous albums are from one another.\\n\\nIn 2014, Bush announced her first live shows in 35 years, with tickets to all 22 dates selling out in less than 15 minutes.

I am not an expert on Canadian law about open carrying so I will not be able to say that. But most likely they would have said that it was \\'kirpan\\' which is a small blade whereas they had swords in their hand.

They would shout slogans to intimidate us. Whenever we were attending public events, again, they would shout slogans to intimidate us,\" he said.\\n\\nSharing an incident, Sanjay Verma said, \"In one instance, close to Diwali, they created 10 heads for me, called me Ravan.

Then what is it?\"\\n\\n\"I reported this to the foreign ministry. The response was that we forwarded it to the relevant authorities, which is correct. We also do the same.

Not to come out,\" he stated.\\n\\nWhen asked if he at any point in time he felt threatened physically?\\n\\nSanjay Verma replied, \" Threatened, yes. But did I become threatened? No. In most of my public events, there will be these hooligans outside shouting slogans against India, but also against me.

They tried to intimidate me through such, slogans shouting, and abusing me verbally. That was reported,\" he stated.\\n\\nSpeaking about his security, Sanjay Verma said, \"I had Canadian security, both the federal and local.\"\\n\\nAsked about whether Sanjay Verma at any point in time doubted their ability to protect him, he replied, \"No, that I won\\'t say. They were very professional, well-trained, and very respectful. So as far as the police officers who were protecting us and now protecting my colleagues there, very, very professional, never had an iota of doubt on their professionalism.\"\\n\\nAdding further he said, \"But unfortunately, the statement which we saw in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police press briefing, where even the investigation has not been concluded, that was a sad thing to see.\"\\n\\nHigh Commissioner Verma said that he was there to serve India\\'s national interest and was committed to doing so.\\n\\n\"So diplomacy for most of us would be, you know, being nice, nice cities.

Many just want to sabotage our exceptionalism, and fundamentally transform us -- into The Americas first, then the United Nations. Not only politically and economically, but also culturally.\\n\\nTrump's plans to mass deport the illegal aliens will help salvage American values, but, in the meantime, our society's preferences have already been transformed. A few of our favorite things are distinctly un-American.\\n\\nAmericans adore our pets, and dogs are the most popular. Representing a radical transformation of preferences, Chihuahuas are now ranked number one.\\n\\nChihuahuas?! That's less of a dog than a poodle, for heaven's sake. Invoking Plato's Forms (abstract things and concepts that most accurately represent reality) as the benchmark, Chihuahuas would barely qualify under the Form of dog-ness. They are absent from the local dog-walking group, for example. In fact, they are nowhere to be seen at the local dog park, but somehow these lapdogs have become the most popular breed in America. We are really in decline.\\n\\nUntil recently, proper dogs like Labradors were perennially the most popular breed, per the American Kennel Club. Other favored breeds include real dogs like Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, and Bulldogs. Poodles also usually make the top 10, but that's probably because 68% of females own dogs (compared to 80% of men), and poodles sport quite a feminine disposition.\\n\\nChihuahuas are fine, I suppose, having basic traits that humans favor, such as loyalty. The best thing about a Chihuahua is that it is not a Shih-Tzu, still, they are rather unaesthetic and yappy. Unsurprisingly, they are particularly prevalent in the West, including New Mexico.\\n\\nWhich leads to considerations of other trends that may be influenced by old Mexico. In some staples, the popularity of products from one of our biggest trading partners now surpass good ole American stalwarts.\\n\\nOdds are that if someone allows a Chihuahua to domicile with them, their favorite beer is Modelo, another import from Mexico. Indeed, Modelo Especial has recently risen to America's favorite beer. Sure, Bud's demise was hastened after their misguided embrace of fringe sub-cultures, but what about Coors or Miller as an all-American replacement?\\n\\nFor those preferring to imbibe the hard stuff, one might consider whiskey, a good American bourbon or Tennessee brand, or perhaps a martini (shaken or stirred). Think again... Tequila is now the best-selling spirit in America. Authentic tequila is made in Mexico, mostly the state of Jalisco. President Trump has proposed a tariff on it.\\n\\nBetter not drink on an empty stomach, though, so perhaps a nice sandwich will hit the spot? Actually, tortilla sales have surpassed white sandwich bread as the first choice for enveloping tasty treats.\\n\\nFrom our beloved pets to our selected drinks and gastronomic desires, some of America's favorites -- the things that bring simple, everyday pleasure and contentment -- have been supplanted commensurate with invasions across our porous border. In these important cultural elements, we are gradually becoming The Americas.\\n\\nAs Lady Liberty projects her welcome to the world's downtrodden masses, we remain a generous and compassionate people to those who wish to assimilate legally. Nevertheless, Trump better resume his presidency (with loyal advisors) and start mass deportations -- of the criminal illegal aliens -- before we devolve into a nebulous country mirroring the United Nations. Some of their favorite things are rather repulsive.\", 'source': {'uri': 'americanthinker.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'American Thinker'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://images.americanthinker.com/ps/pss9mcoax8vz2wnrhim5_800.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 467555103, 'relevance': 1}, {'uri': '8380484115', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-25', 'time': '12:25:03', 'dateTime': '2024-10-25T12:25:03Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-25T12:24:43Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/25/dodgers-will-wear-patch-honoring-fernando-valenzuela-in-world-series/', 'title': 'Dodgers will wear patch honoring Fernando Valenzuela in World Series and 2025', 'body': \"LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers will wear a patch on their uniforms honoring Fernando Valenzuela during the World Series.\\n\\nValenzuela died this week at age 63.

Sub-Saharan African nations that depend on commodity exports need to reform their economies to tackle patchy regional economic growth, International Monetary Fund Africa Director Abebe Aemro Selassie said.\\n\\nThe region is expected to grow by 3.6% this year, unchanged from last year and down from an April forecast of 3.8%, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook released this week, with commodity economies lagging their diversified counterparts.\\n\\nThe commodity intensive countries are growing at about half the rate of the rest of the region, the IMF said in the report, with oil exporters struggling the most in what it described as \"subdued and uneven\" regional growth.\\n\\n\"South Sudan, Nigeria, Angola are all very much in that camp,\" Abebe told Reuters.\\n\\nWhile diversified economies such as Senegal and Tanzania are expected to grow at above the regional average, Nigeria will fall short, growing at 2.9%, according to the IMF\\'s regional economic outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa launched on Friday.\\n\\n\"They have had very large macroeconomic imbalances, financing challenges which have held back growth,\" Abebe said.\\n\\nHe said the government in Nigeria needed to \"squarely address\" those challenges, since they had caused high inflation and put pressure on the cost of living.\\n\\nPresident Bola Tinubu\\'s government has launched a series of reforms it says are aimed at lifting economic growth and attracting investment.\\n\\nSouth Africa, whose growth has been curbed by crippling electricity blackouts, is expected to grow by 1.1% this year, the IMF said.\\n\\nArmed conflicts are also weighing on growth, the IMF said, citing South Sudan\\'s oil exports blocked by conflict in neighbouring Sudan, which hosts the crude export pipeline.\\n\\n\"They (oil exporters) need to find new sources of growth, get more private sector investment - so working on reforms that will facilitate that is important,\" Abebe said.\\n\\nOther challenges facing African oil producers include the global transition to green fuels due to climate change, the report said.\\n\\nSMALL REBOUND\\n\\nSub-Saharan Africa\\'s economic growth is expected to improve slightly next year to 4.2%, the IMF report said.\\n\\nThe report found that nearly half of the 20 fastest growing economies in the world this year were in Sub-Saharan Africa, but cautioned that faster growth rates were required to reduce widespread poverty and inequalities.\\n\\nOne of the main obstacles to faster growth include a lack of access to affordable financing, the IMF said, as countries struggle with heavy debt loads and high debt servicing costs.\\n\\nWhile some countries have been able to sell bonds on international capital markets this year following a two-year hiatus caused by geopolitical shocks and elevated interest rates in advanced economies such as the United States, the new funding came at a high cost.\\n\\n\"The old development finance architecture is not delivering, and, if anything, kind of is in the process of disintegrating,\" Abebe said, citing \"very problematic levels\" of official bilateral funding for poor countries.\\n\\nFor countries such as Kenya, where deadly anti-tax hikes protests in June forced the government to withdraw its finance bill for this fiscal year, such development assistance from overseas has been falling in recent years, a senior U.N. official told Reuters.\\n\\nThe solutions lay in ensuring that poor nations continue to access low-priced development financing from bilateral and multilateral lenders, Abebe said.\\n\\n\"We need also to find ways in which when countries are facing liquidity rather than solvency challenges, more financing can be made available for them to support reforms so they can move on to better times,\" he said.\\n\\n(Reporting by Duncan Miriri and Karin Strohecker; Graphics by Sumanta Sen; Editing by Alison Williams)', 'source': {'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}, 'authors': [], 'image': None, 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.05882352941176472, 'wgt': 467555102, 'relevance': 1}, {'uri': '8380484196', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-25', 'time': '12:25:02', 'dateTime': '2024-10-25T12:25:02Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-25T12:24:49Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://allafrica.com/stories/202410250316.html', 'title': \"Somalia: Turkish Vessel Oruc Reis Docks At Mogadishu Port Ahead of Oil and Gas Exploration Off Somalia's Coast\", 'body': 'Ankara, Turkey -- In a move to bolster its energy security and assert its maritime exploration capabilities, Türkiye\\'s state-of-the-art seismic research vessel, Oruc Reis, has embarked on a significant mission to explore the seabed off Somalia for potential oil and natural gas deposits.\\n\\nThe announcement was made by Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar on Friday, marking a pivotal moment in the country\\'s international energy strategy.\\n\\nBayraktar took to X to confirm the vessel\\'s arrival, posting, \"Oruc Reis has reached its mission location after its journey across continents.\" This voyage not only represents Türkiye\\'s commitment to expanding its energy portfolio but also highlights its capability to conduct advanced seismic surveys in regions far from its own coasts.\\n\\nThe deployment of Oruc Reis underscores Türkiye\\'s ambition to tap into new hydrocarbon resources as part of a broader geopolitical strategy.

Why Shell\\'s Divestment from the Niger Delta Must not Harm Human Rights\", held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\\n\\nDummett told the government that it must ensure that the divestment does not limit Shell\\'s liabilities without a full investigation into and remediation of all existing pollution, the maintenance and repair of existing pipelines, and the protection of pipelines from sabotage.He said: \"Amnesty International has documented grievous and enduring human rights abuses resulting from oil contamination in the area, where Shell has operated since the 1950s. Amnesty International is concerned that the proposed sale will deny people already harmed access to adequate remedy, and potentially expose many more to future abuses.\"\\n\\nThe report recommends a series of safeguards and action to help protect the rights of people potentially affected by Shell\\'s planned disposal of its onshore oil interest in the Niger Delta, reportedly for about US$3billion.\\n\\nSpeaking further, Dummett noted that \"For decades spills have damaged the health and livelihoods of many of the Niger Delta\\'s inhabitants .\"\\n\\nAccording to him, \"Shell should not be allowed to wash its hands of the problems and leave. Shell has earned billions of dollars from this business and it must make sure that its withdrawal does not have negative human rights and environmental consequences.\"\\n\\nThe report also stated that \"The government should consider requiring Shell to act as guarantor to ensure any purchaser is capable of making good and remediating damage caused by any future spills and that any buyer is committed to transparency, environmental compliance, consultations with communities, and limiting greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\n\"By exercising appropriate oversight to Shell\\'s sale, Nigeria\\'s incoming administration has a unique opportunity to demonstrate its determination to upload and protect the human rights of its citizens, including their rights to an adequate standard of living, clean water, and health. We are also calling for effective remedy for people whose rights have long been abused.\"\\n\\nObserving that \"Shell is not uniquely responsible for the devastating oil pollution that blight the Niger Delta,\" Dummett said other actors in the devastation include, federal and state authorities, adding that \"They too have the obligation to ensure that Shell\\'s divestment does not lead to further human rights harm. \"', 'source': {'uri': 'allafrica.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'allAfrica'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.05098039215686279, 'wgt': 467555101, 'relevance': 1}, {'uri': '8380484095', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-25', 'time': '12:25:01', 'dateTime': '2024-10-25T12:25:01Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-25T12:24:42Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/uknews/2024/10/25/residents-at-care-home-where-three-people-died-felt-safe-according-to-report/', 'title': \"Residents at care home where three people died 'felt safe', according to report\", 'body': 'Family members and residents of a care home where three people died of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning previously told inspectors that the staff were \"very safety conscious\", according to reports by the healthcare watchdog.\\n\\nDorset Police received a report at 7:16am on Wednesday regarding three residents - two men, aged 74 and 91, and an 86-year-old woman - who were found dead at Gainsborough Care Home in Ulwell Road, Swanage.\\n\\nSeven people were taken to hospital as a precaution and were not in a serious condition, the force has said.\\n\\nThe deaths are being treated as unexplained and detectives are still exploring possible carbon monoxide poisoning as the primary line of inquiry.

Hannah joined the E4 show halfway through and was accused of flirting with a few husbands on the show.

A 32-year-old woman named Alexandra Pennig had been found dead in her bathroom with a single gunshot wound to the head.\\n\\nFor the detectives, what really happened to Pennig is something that still haunts them to this day. And it\\'s the question at the center of \"The Strange Shooting of Alex Pennig,\" reported by \"48 Hours\" contributor Natalie Morales airing Saturday, Oct. 26 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.\\n\\nWhen detectives DeSanto and O\\'Donnell arrived at the apartment, they found out Pennig had not been alone at the time of her death. A man named Matthew Ecker was also there. Ecker and Pennig were both nurses and had met two years earlier when they worked at the same clinic. Ecker told first responders the gun was his, and that Pennig had grabbed it, locked herself in the bathroom, and then fired the shot. \"I thought everything was fine,\" he said. \"And then she just grabbed the gun.\" Ecker told first responders that after he heard the shot he immediately broke open the bathroom door: \"I tried to do what I could. And then I washed my hands ... That\\'s why I don\\'t have anything on my hands.\" Ecker said he then called 911. But it was too late. He said he didn\\'t know why Pennig would do this.\\n\\nIn Pennig\\'s apartment, there was alcohol and six bottles of prescription medication, including antidepressants, all prescribed to Pennig. For the detectives, it suggested Alex might have been depressed, and they wondered if Ecker\\'s story that she took her own life was true.\\n\\nBut they also noticed something that seemed to contradict Ecker\\'s story. He had said he washed his hands in the bathroom sink before calling 911, but DeSanto recalled the first responders told her the sink was dry. \"The sink was dry. If he had said, you know, he called the police right away, that sink probably would\\'ve been still wet,\" DeSanto explained, \"but it was very dry in there.\"\\n\\nWhen O\\'Donnell looked into Pennig\\'s background, she learned from Alex\\'s parents that Alex had struggled in the past with depression and addiction. \"I had asked, um, if she had been suicidal in the past, um, and dad said, she had, um, tried, uh, to overdose before,\" said O\\'Donnell. According to Alex\\'s father, Jim Pennig, several years prior, Alex had taken a handful of pills \"and then had told her mom that she was attempting suicide.\" After that, Alex\\'s parents told the detectives they sent her to rehab, and she eventually got clean. Despite her past struggles, Alex\\'s parents told O\\'Donnell they had just seen her at Thanksgiving. And her mom, Mary Jo Pennig, had just talked to her that evening. \"She was doing well,\" she said. For them, the idea that their daughter had died by suicide did not make sense. \"Knowing your kid, it didn\\'t fit,\" Mary Jo Pennig said.\\n\\nSince Ecker was the last person to see Alex Pennig alive, the detectives zeroed in on him. \"He\\'s the only one that can tell us what happened. He was the only one that was there,\" said O\\'Donnell. They questioned Ecker about what had happened that night. He said he and Alex Pennig had gone out to several local bars, and when they arrived back at her place, everything was fine: \"We were laughing on the way home,\" said Ecker. DeSanto asked him if, once they got into the apartment, they had gotten into a fight. Ecker said they did not.\\n\\nDET. ABBY DESANTO: You guys weren\\'t arguing or anything?\\n\\nMATTHEW ECKER: No.\\n\\nDET. ABBY DESANTO: There\\'s no fight with you two?\\n\\nMATTHEW ECKER: Not between us.\\n\\nFor hours, Ecker continued to say Pennig had locked herself in the bathroom, fired the shot and then he broke open the door to try and help her: \"That gun went off behind a closed door ... I did not shoot her.\"\\n\\nBut the detectives had their doubts. Then they got a call from the forensic unit that was still processing the scene. And according to O\\'Donnell, what they found changed everything. \"Once Alex was moved, they found underneath where Alex had been laying was a round metal piece,\" she said. \"It was the shape of a ring, and about the size of a quarter.\" O\\'Donnell said it was part of the lock from the bathroom door, and the fact that it had been discovered under Pennig was key. \"For us, it meant that the door was forced open before she was shot.\"\\n\\nThe detectives felt the discovery of the metal ring proved Ecker had lied and had not broken the door open after he heard the shot. The detectives suspected Pennig and Ecker had argued and that she had locked the bathroom door to get away from him. Then Ecker broke open the door, the metal part broke off and fell to the ground, and then he shot Pennig and she landed on top of it.\\n\\nEcker was charged with second-degree murder. In February 2024 he was convicted and later sentenced to 30 years. He is appealing his conviction.', 'source': {'uri': 'dnyuz.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'DNyuz'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-a-small-piece-of-a-bathroom-door-lock-helped.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2941176470588235, 'wgt': 467555075, 'relevance': 1}, {'uri': '8380483383', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': True, 'date': '2024-10-25', 'time': '12:24:34', 'dateTime': '2024-10-25T12:24:34Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-25T12:24:13Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.waterford-news.ie/poll-are-you-fed-up-of-the-clocks-going-back_arid-36074.html', 'title': 'Poll: Are you fed up of the clocks going back? - Homepage - Waterford News & Star', 'body': 'With the looming eventuality of the clocks going back on Sunday, resistance to the practice has resurfaced.\\n\\nEvery year the clocks go back an hour at 2am on the last Sunday of October, seeing Ireland\\'s time zone switch from Irish Summer Time to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).\\n\\nSeán Kelly, Fine Gael MEP for Ireland South, said the clock changes are an \"outdated practice\" that have negative effects on health, well-being, and safety.\\n\\nSo, if you had your way, would the clock changes stay or go?

United\\'s defensive porousness means Onana has been kept far busier than he would like since his arrival at the club. No goalkeeper has faced more shots in the last two Premier League seasons. But his saves have often kept their heads above water.\\n\\nAccording to Opta\\'s expected goal model, Onana is third among goalkeepers, behind only Arijanet Muric and Emiliano Martinez, for expected goals prevented since the start of last term, his saves worth a whopping 7.14 goals, based on the quality of chances faced.\\n\\nOf course, it is his errors, mostly concentrated in his first few months at the club, which stick in the memory. Perceptions were shaped early among Premier League viewers. But his value has become clear to United fans and a broader reassessment is probably overdue.\\n\\nThere were of course costly mistakes in the Champions League last year. In the Premier League, though, Onana has only made two errors leading to shots in 46 games, according to Opta. It is half as many as Alisson and three fewer than Martinez since the start of last season.\\n\\nHis occasional mis-steps continue to be pounced upon by critics. But his heroics on Thursday night were just the latest reminder that United would be worse off without him.\\n\\nArsenal\\'s injury issues, coupled with unconvincing displays against Bournemouth and Shakhtar Donetsk, have added to the clamour for teenager Ethan Nwaneri to be given more chances. Mikel Arteta\\'s perceived reluctance has prompted criticism from some fans.\\n\\nWatching his cameos this season, it is easy to understand the desire to see more of him. Nwaneri, characterised by driving runs and smooth footwork, is clearly a thrilling prospect. Inside the club, he is seen as having the humility and work ethic to match his talent.\\n\\nCould Arteta have made more use of him against Bournemouth and Shakhtar? Probably. Arsenal looked clunky at the Vitality Stadium even before William Saliba\\'s red card. Nwaneri is probably the closest thing Arteta has in his squad to a Martin Odegaard alternative.\\n\\nBut it still feels harsh to criticise the manager who made him the youngest player in Premier League history, aged 15 years and 181 against Brentford in 2022, over a lack of opportunity.\\n\\nArteta said that historic appearance at the Gtech Community Stadium was motivated by \"gut instinct\" at the time. In truth, it was more calculated than he let on; an attempt to show the club\\'s most prodigiously talented academy player a pathway to the first-team.\\n\\nInevitably, though, it also thrust him into the consciousness of supporters who, two years on, have only seen him make a further five competitive appearances at senior level.\\n\\nIt may not feel like much but it is important to remember Nwaneri only became old enough to sign a professional contract in March and is still five months from his 18th birthday. He is the second-youngest of 440 players to have played in the Premier League this season.\\n\\nIt is worth noting, too, that Nwaneri is ahead of others of comparative potential. His total of five Premier League appearances already matches that of Manchester City\\'s Phil Foden at 18. Bukayo Saka, his fellow Arsenal academy graduate, did not reach the same milestone until a month after turning 18.\\n\\nThere is, perhaps, a broader question to be asked about Arteta\\'s use of academy players. Saka is the only one who makes their strongest team now. But that scarcity is a natural consequence of rising standards. Arsenal have gone from top-four hopefuls to title challengers under his management.\\n\\nIt is a testament to Nwaneri\\'s ability that he already looks capable of stepping up. But over-exposure at such a young age brings risks. And besides, at 17, it is more accurate to say he is ahead of schedule than being held back by his manager. His time will come.\\n\\nAlexander Isak\\'s 21 Premier League goals last season put him behind only Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer but he goes into Newcastle\\'s meeting with Chelsea, live on Sky Sports on Sunday, having only found the net once in six games. He does not look himself.\\n\\nThe 25-year-old has been hindered by a broken toe, admittedly, missing three games before Saturday\\'s 1-0 loss to Brighton. But his one-on-one effort saved by Bart Verbruggen, one of seven shots without scoring in the game, seemed to sum up his recent struggles.\\n\\nIn total, it is one goal from 18 shots this season. A conversion rate which stood at 27 per cent last season, and 20 per cent the year before that, has fallen to only six per cent this term.\\n\\nIt should be noted, however, that, according to Opta\\'s expected goals model, that one-on-one chance against Brighton was one of only two high-value opportunities he has had all season.\\n\\nHe converted the other, from Jacob Murphy\\'s pass across goal to clinch the 2-1 win over Tottenham in September. Otherwise, though, he has been limited to low-quality chances, his average of 0.42 non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes down from 0.62 last season.\\n\\nIt is of course partly the responsibility of a striker to generate scoring chances. Isak has so far lacked his usual sharpness. But the responsibility for his scoring struggles should be shared. Better service is needed to return to the heights of last season.\\n\\nEverton\\'s Iliman Ndiaye has been fun to watch this season.

The result isn't just an epic fantasy show with a grand scope, but one that homes in on the intimate personal stakes.\\n\\n[Ed. note: This review contains spoilers for The Legend of Vox Machina season 3.]\\n\\nThe third season of The Legend of Vox Machina picks up right where the last one left off: Raishan (Cree Summer), one of the dragons in the group bent on taking over the world, reaches out to the adventuring party and offers them intel on a magical item that could stop the tyrannical dragon leader.\\n\\nBut, predictably, the adventurers of Vox Machina have a lot going on in this season, and not just when it comes to defeating the big bad dragon. Bard Scanlan (Sam Riegel), for instance, wishes to repair the relationship he has with his estranged daughter. Druid Keyleth (Marisha Ray) and rogue Vax (Liam O'Brien) dance around a romantic relationship while facing their own internal battles, as do Vex (Laura Bailey) and Percy (Taliesin Jaffe). Pike (Ashley Johnson) grapples with her faith, and barbarian Grog (Travis Willingham)... well, Grog's actually pretty peachy this season. There's world and lore to expand and minor character backstories to flesh out, and still, even with all of that in 12 half-hour episodes, the show doesn't actually feel like it's taking on too much.\\n\\nIt's because the creators know when to slow down. Improvised banter is built into the original campaign, but it proves to be a valuable asset in figuring out when to let the emotional beats sit for a moment. The characters may be facing increasing stakes and bigger foes, but they're also feeling the effects of those things.\\n\\nFor the audience, this is incredibly valuable. These days, a lot of high-stakes shows don't bother to really drill in on the downtime or the moments between big world-ending plot points. Eight hour-long episodes go by in a breathless blur. But The Legend of Vox Machina checks in with the characters, how they're feeling about themselves, their mission, and each other. Even with everything happening, they're not on all the time. There's a whole bit where they take a moment to rest and recover in Scanlan's fabulous dream mansion, for instance, and it's a chance for them to hit pause and reflect. And some of the best decisions the creative team makes are in integrating more of these moments that weren't in the original campaign.\\n\\nCase in point: Percy's death. In the tabletop session, he was dead for a bit, but quickly revived. And for a D&D game with friends, that makes sense, since you want to keep the game going. But for a television show, having an easy resurrection would turn a big consequential moment into just a handwave. Dr. Anna Ripley (Kelly Hu) would be easy to dismiss as a threat, and there wouldn't be a chance for the rest of the characters to reflect. Ultimately, Percy does come back (in a different way, with new ramifications), but turning it into a few-episode-long arc really just emphasizes the personal stakes in a way that this show does very well.\\n\\nThe writers and directors have a daunting task with this show: Adapt hours and hours (and hours) of actual play into 12 half-hour episodes. The fact that they've so smartly zeroed in on what's important to the characters and the story is impressive, as is the fact that they know when to change those beats and make them fit within the structure of television. Letting Percy's death sit longer allows for the other characters -- particularly Vex -- to really reexamine their own priorities, while also heightening the fact that characters can and will die if they don't defeat the big bad.\\n\\nIt's not that The Legend of Vox Machina has more episodes or run time to fill these emotional beats in than other fantasy shows; it's that the creators know to give them just as much weight as the epic battles and big villain showdowns. The action sequences are certainly fun and intense, but they're not dragged on or given more precedence than quiet moments watching a sunrise. The allure of Critical Role has always been the characters (and the actors behind them), and that focus on the small stakes as well as the large ones is what levels up The Legend of Vox Machina. And in the third season, when so much is happening, yet there's still space for that muchness to breathe, it's more evident than ever that this show is something special.\", 'source': {'uri': 'dnyuz.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'DNyuz'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/In-a-world-without-filler-episodes-The-Legend-of-Vox.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.192156862745098, 'wgt': 467555074, 'relevance': 1}, {'uri': '8380482641', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-25', 'time': '12:24:33', 'dateTime': '2024-10-25T12:24:33Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-25T12:23:36Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14001391/Davina-McCall-menopause-HRT-hack.html', 'title': \"Davina McCall's menopause GP reveals genius hack to reduce HRT risk\", 'body': \"Davina McCall's menopause doctor has revealed a surprising hack that tackles a little-known risk of using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) drugs.\\n\\nDr Naomi Potter, who co-wrote the 2022 book 'Menopausing' with Ms McCall, shared the tip on how to stop the hands becoming contaminated gel forms of the medicine.\\n\\nIn a video on Instagram Dr Potter, who is a British Menopause Society specialist, describes 'a hands-free' method of applying oestrogen gel, which she says is 'the best way'.\\n\\nHRT, which mimics the hormones that drop naturally in a woman's body as a consequence of the menopause, is used by almost two million women in the UK.\\n\\nGels contain the female hormone oestrogen which is absorbed through the skin, typically applied to the arms, thighs, abdomen or buttocks.\\n\\nBut after applying it, traces of the gel may remain to the hands which can then be transferred to a partner or child, or even a pet, when a woman touches them.\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\nA post shared by Dr Naomi Potter | Menopause Doctor (@dr_naomipotter)\\n\\nDr Naomi Potter (right), a British Menopause Society accredited hormone specialist who has worked with celebrities like Davina McCall (left)on menopause awareness, shared a trick on how to stop your hands becoming contaminated with HRT drugs\\n\\nFor this reason, women who use the gel are advised to wash their hands thoroughly after applying the drug.\\n\\nWhile the risk is extremely small, exposing children and men to excess oestrogen could theoretically trigger problems, such as excess breast tissue growth.\\n\\nDr Potter shared the neat hack she says he learned from her own patients on how to avoid this risk entirely.\\n\\n'Most commonly women push the pump dispenser down onto their hand and rub it in,' she said in the clip which has been viewed more than 50,000 times.\\n\\nRead More Fury at viral food guru Eddie Abbew for claiming perimenopause is 'BS' and can be reversed with diet\\n\\nHowever, Dr Potter added: 'One way you can avoid the contamination on your hand is simply by using the top of the Oestrogel [brand of gel] bottle.'\\n\\n'You put your dispense dose down on the top of the bottle and then you can apply it.\\n\\n'Then let it dry, and your hands are left completely uncontaminated by the additional oestrogen.'\\n\\nHRT can come in tablets, patches, gels and sprays and several high-profile celebrities, including Penny Lancaster and Ms McCall have spoken about how the drugs have transformed their lives.\\n\\nAccording to the NHS, the risk of developing serious side-effects on HRT are 'very low', although it can lead to a small increase in breast cancer risk.\\n\\nMenopause occurs when a woman stops having periods and is no longer able to get pregnant naturally.\\n\\nIt is a normal part of ageing and is marked by levels of the sex hormone oestrogen dropping.\\n\\nIt typically starts between the age of 45 and 55 for most women.\\n\\nHowever, it can occur earlier, naturally for a minority of women, and as a result of other health problems and treatments, like those for cancer.\\n\\nSome women go through this time with few, if any, symptoms.

Kriti, in a bold dual-role performance as twin sisters Shailee and Saumya, impressed viewers with her skill at portraying contrasting personalities. Shaheer Sheikh also received praise for his role, while Kajol brought her signature intensity to the screen.

New ERA was made possible by President Biden\\'s Inflation Reduction Act, which makes the largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936.\\n\\nNew ERA program funding is available to member-owned rural electric cooperatives, which have been the backbone of America\\'s rural power delivery for nearly a century. Today\\'s investment in rural co-ops will create good-paying jobs and make energy more affordable for families in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, Minnesota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming.\\n\\n\"Since day one of his administration, President Biden has remained committed to ensuring rural communities are directly benefitting from a clean energy economy,\" Secretary Vilsack said. \"Through today\\'s announcement, USDA is delivering on this commitment with critical funding from the President\\'s historic Inflation Reduction Act.

Under President Biden and Vice President Harris\\'s leadership, we are making significant investments to ensure that those communities are receiving clean, carbon-free energy - which will reduce the pollution in our air and water, create good-paying jobs, and lower families\\' home energy costs,\" said White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. \"By helping rural cooperatives upgrade infrastructure and invest in newer, lower cost clean electricity projects, these investments will benefit rural families and businesses who for too long have faced disproportionately high energy costs due to the challenges of providing electricity in remote communities.\"\\n\\nToday in Westminster, Colorado, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Torres Small joined the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association to highlight the benefits of the nearly $2.5 billion in financing, made possible by a combination of grants and loans through the program. Tri-State\\'s award is expected to reduce electricity rates 10 percent for cooperative members by 2034, amassing $430 million in rural consumer benefits over ten years. New ERA funds will finance the purchase of 1,040 megawatts of renewable energy and more than 200 megawatts of energy storage. New ERA funds will also help Tri-State refinance the retirement of 1,100 megawatts of previously and newly announced coal-fired energy generation. The investments will provide affordable, reliable, and resilient energy to Tri-State\\'s cooperative members across Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Wyoming. This investment will reduce climate pollution by nearly 5.8 million tons annually. This transformative investment is expected to create more than 2,000 jobs.\\n\\nUSDA also announced six electric cooperatives to move forward in the New ERA process. The six cooperatives are:\\n\\nUSDA will be investing nearly $1 billion in grants and loans for these six new selectees, which will leverage investments of $6.4 billion for 1.75 gigawatts of clean energy for rural communities across the country. The selectees announced today will reduce and avoid at least 6.4 million tons of greenhouse gases annually.\\n\\nIncluding today\\'s announcements, USDA has announced over $8.3 billion in funding as part of the New ERA program to benefit rural electric cooperatives and their members through the New ERA program. USDA expects this over $8.3 billion to result in over $13 billion in New ERA financed grants and loans. These projects will create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for rural communities, significantly reduce pollution, enhance the resiliency of the nation\\'s electric grid, and advance the Biden-Harris Administration\\'s Justice40 Initiative. One in five rural Americans will benefit from these clean energy investments.\\n\\nFarmer Benefit Plan\\n\\nUSDA also announced the release of a Farmer Benefit Plan as an innovative way for New ERA awardees to demonstrate ways for agricultural producers to benefit from clean energy projects. USDA encourages each award recipient to collaborate with local stakeholders to develop a Community Benefit Plan. During the first year of the award, applicants will collaborate with their communities and local farm associations to codevelop a plan. Based on the New ERA applications received so far, coops are collaborating with 154 local community groups, including 50 farm organizations, to explore local priorities.\\n\\nAs part of their New ERA award, Tri-State will develop a Farmer Benefit Plan that aims to lower electricity costs for farmers who voluntarily participate in a smart irrigation program. The goal of the program is to reduce pumping load at the times of peak demand. This will help reduce future energy needs and offset the need to build new transmission and generation, saving cooperative members from future costs. Tri-State will work with farmers to execute additional energy programs to encourage the most efficient use of electricity and water and will provide no-cost technical support to enable participation in these opportunities.

These results, combined with those from the ADORING 1 and ADORING 2 pivotal studies, demonstrate VTAMA cream\\'s potential ability to not only effectively and safely treat patients as young as 2 years of age with atopic dermatitis, but may also enable a majority to achieve complete disease clearance, and maintain either clear or almost clear skin for an average of over 2 and a half months while off all treatment.\"\\n\\nADORING 1 and ADORING 2 were two identical, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of VTAMA cream, 1% in adults and pediatric patients as young as 2 years old with AD who had a Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 3 (moderate) to 4 (severe) at baseline. ADORING 3, a 48-week open-label, long-term extension (LTE) study, enrolled eligible patients from ADORING 1, ADORING 2, a 4-week maximal usage pharmacokinetics study, and VTAMA cream-naive patients aged 2-17 years with either mild, moderate or severe AD that did not meet inclusion in ADORING 1 and ADORING 2.\\n\\nIn ADORING 3, patients were followed for up to 48 weeks, with safety and tolerability endpoints that included treatment emergent adverse events, adverse events of special interest, investigator-assessed and patient/caregiver-assessed local tolerability, and efficacy endpoints that included the achievement of complete disease clearance (vIGA-AD=0), and the achievement of clear or almost clear skin (vIGA-AD=0 or 1). Patients entering with any disease activity (vIGA-AD≥1) were treated with VTAMA cream, 1% until complete disease clearance was achieved (vIGA-AD=0). Those entering with or achieving complete clearance (vIGA-AD=0) discontinued VTAMA cream, 1% and were followed to measure the treatment-free interval, defined as the maintenance of clear or almost clear skin (vIGA-AD=0 or 1) for consecutive days while no longer receiving any treatment for AD. Patients whose AD returned to mild or above (vIGA-AD≥2) were re-treated until complete disease clearance (vIGA-AD=0) was achieved again. ADORING 3 reinforced the safety and tolerability of VTAMA cream, 1% demonstrated in ADORING 1 and ADORING 2.\\n\\nADORING 3 LTE Skin Clearance and Other Results:\\n\\n728 patients enrolled in ADORING 3; of which 83.0% were pediatric patients (2-17 years) proportionally balanced across defined pediatric age groups. Overall, 51.9% (378/728) of patients entered with or achieved complete disease clearance (vIGA-AD=0) at least once during the 48-week study, while 81.6% (594/728) entered with or achieved clear or almost clear skin (vIGA-AD=0 or 1) at least once during the 48-week study. After entering with or first achieving complete disease clearance and discontinuing VTAMA cream, 1% treatment (n=378), the average duration of the first treatment-free interval was 79.8 consecutive days (with a standard deviation of 81.4 days). After achieving vIGA-AD=0 and discontinuing VTAMA cream, 1%, patients whose vIGA-AD returned to ≥2 (mild or above) off-treatment could regain vIGA-AD=0 when re-treated. No evidence of tachyphylaxis (loss of response) in patients receiving either continuous or intermittent therapy of VTAMA cream, 1% was observed for up to 48 weeks. Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate; the most frequent were folliculitis (12.1%), nasopharyngitis (6.9%), and upper respiratory tract infection (6.9%). Study discontinue rate due to TEAEs were low (2.6%). Adverse events of special interest (AESI), follicular events, contact dermatitis, and headache were mostly mild or moderate and associated with low study discontinuation rates (1.0%, 0.4%, and 0% respectively). There was no study discontinuation due to headache. VTAMA cream, 1% was well tolerated, even when applied to affected sensitive skin areas, including the face (n=374) and neck (n=398).\\n\\nVTAMA cream, 1% is a novel, aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist in development in the U.S. as a once-daily, cosmetically elegant, and steroid-free, topical cream for both acute treatment and long-term management of AD. VTAMA cream, 1% is currently approved for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults in the U.S. In April 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the company\\'s Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for VTAMA® (tapinarof) cream, 1% for the topical treatment of AD in adults and children 2 years of age and older. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (\"PDUFA\") action date assigned by the Agency is in Q4 2024.\\n\\nAbout Dermavant\\'s Phase 3 Program for VTAMA cream in Atopic Dermatitis\\n\\nADORING is Dermavant\\'s Phase 3 atopic dermatitis (AD) clinical development program for VTAMA® (tapinarof) cream, 1%, which consists of ADORING 1 (NCT05014568) and ADORING 2 (NCT05032859), as well as ADORING 3 (NCT05142774), a 48-week open-label, long-term extension study.\\n\\nAbout Atopic Dermatitis\\n\\nAtopic dermatitis (AD), commonly referred to as eczema, is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases, affects over 26 million people in the U.S. alone and up to 10% of adults worldwide. AD occurs most frequently in children, affecting up to 20% worldwide. The disease results in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin, often affecting the folds of the arms, back of the knees, hands, face, and neck. Itching is an especially bothersome symptom in AD, and tends to worsen at night, disturbing sleep and causing fatigue, which in children can lead to inattention at school. People with AD may also experience social and emotional distress due to the visibility and discomfort of the disease.\\n\\nAbout Dermavant\\n\\nDermavant Sciences, a subsidiary of Roivant Sciences, is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics in immuno-dermatology.
